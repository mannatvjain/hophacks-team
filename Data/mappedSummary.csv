10.1016/0304-3940(86)90466-0, "This intellectual lineage begins with the discovery of long-term potentiation (LTP) as a fundamental cellular mechanism of memory, a finding that provides the biological substrate for a two-stage model of memory formation, which, in turn, explains how neural reactivation consolidates memories during rest, a process that ultimately inspired the design of modern deep reinforcement learning systems."
10.1016/0306-4522(88)90127-3, "The research path here centers on the two-stage model of hippocampal memory, from its theoretical proposal as a short-term-to-long-term consolidation process, to the identification of sharp wave bursts as a critical event for memory trace formation, with the entire sequence providing a biological framework that informs the deep reinforcement learning architecture."
10.1016/0006-8993(84)91356-8, "This set of papers establishes a direct lineage from the initial discovery and behavioral characterization of hippocampal sharp wave activity during periods of rest, which provided the basis for a two-stage model of memory formation, and ultimately led to the discovery of neural reactivation during these events, serving as a powerful analogy for deep reinforcement learning."
10.1038/330649a0, "The research trajectory here starts with the foundational cognitive map theory, which established the hippocampus as a spatial memory hub, a concept that was then generalized into a two-stage model of memory consolidation driven by a mechanism of neural reactivation during offline states, providing the biological foundation for deep reinforcement learning."
10.1016/0304-3940(88)90477-6, "This sequence of studies reveals how early research on the physiological properties of hippocampal sharp waves during immobility led to their proposed role in a two-stage model of memory consolidation, a process now confirmed by evidence of neural reactivation and serving as a key analog for deep reinforcement learning."
10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014507, "The papers form a clear intellectual arc from the early physiological description of hippocampal sharp waves to their integration into a two-stage model of memory, a process later understood as neural reactivation during rest, which ultimately provided a biological blueprint for the development of modern deep reinforcement learning."
10.1016/0006-8993(85)90257-4, "The path begins with the foundational physiological characterization of sharp waves, a brain rhythm that was subsequently incorporated into a two-stage model of memory consolidation and shown to be the mechanism for neural reactivation during rest, a process that now serves as a key inspiration for deep reinforcement learning."
10.1016/0006-8993(88)90763-9, "This research chain progresses from the discovery of the hippocampus's role in working memory, to a two-stage model of memory formation that explains how these temporary memories are consolidated offline via neural reactivation, and concludes with the application of these principles in the development of deep reinforcement learning."
10.1038/290413a0, "The papers form a cohesive intellectual chain, progressing from the foundational cognitive map theory of hippocampal function to a two-stage model of memory formation facilitated by brain states like sharp waves, a process now understood to involve neural reactivation during rest, which ultimately provides the biological blueprint for the powerful learning algorithms used in deep reinforcement learning."
10.1016/0006-8993(87)90793-1, "The path of discovery begins with the foundational observation of neural replay during hippocampal sharp waves, a finding that shaped a two-stage model of memory formation and its crucial role in memory consolidation, which provides the biological blueprint for the powerful learning algorithms used in deep reinforcement learning."
