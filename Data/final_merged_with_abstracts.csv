Behavioral experiments suggest that learning is driven by changes in the expectations about future salient events such as rewards and punishments. Physiological work has recently complemented these studies by identifying dopaminergic neurons in the primate whose fluctuating output apparently signals changes or errors in the predictions of future salient and rewarding events. Taken together, these findings can be understood through quantitative theories of adaptive optimizing control."

Such board games offer the challenge of tremendous complexity and sophistication required to play at expert level. At the same time, the problem inputs and performance measures are clear-cut and well defined, and the game environment is readily automated in that it is easy to simulate the board, the rules of legal play, and the rules regarding when the game is over and determining the outcome."

Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such “autoencoder” networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution.

10.1613/jair.3912,[],0.654619,The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents,M. G. Bellemare; Y. Naddaf; J. Veness; M. Bowling,2013.0,"<jats:p>In this article we introduce the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE): both a challenge problem and a platform and methodology for evaluating the development of general, domain-independent AI technology.  ALE provides an interface to hundreds of Atari 2600 game environments, each one different, interesting, and designed to be a challenge for human players.  ALE presents significant research challenges for reinforcement learning, model learning, model-based planning, imitation learning, transfer learning, and intrinsic motivation.  Most importantly, it provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating and comparing approaches to these problems.  We illustrate the promise of ALE by developing and benchmarking domain-independent agents designed using well-established AI techniques for both reinforcement learning and planning.  In doing so, we also propose an evaluation methodology made possible by ALE, reporting empirical results on over 55 different games.  All of the software, including the benchmark agents, is publicly available.

This requirement is consistent with the Hebbian, or correlational, type of learning rule used in many neural network models. Recent evidence suggests that synaptic plasticity may depend in part on the production of a membrane permeant-diffusible signal so that spatial volume may also be involved in correlational learning rules. This latter form of synaptic change has been called volume learning. In both Hebbian and volume learning rules, interaction among synaptic inputs depends on the degree of coincidence of the inputs and is otherwise insensitive to their exact temporal order. Conditioning experiments and psychophysical studies have shown, however, that most animals are highly sensitive to the temporal order of the sensory inputs. Although these experiments assay the behavior of the entire animal or perceptual system, they raise the possibility that nervous systems may be sensitive to temporally ordered events at many spatial and temporal scales. We suggest here the existence of a new class of learning rule, called a predictive Hebbian learning rule, that is sensitive to the temporal ordering of synaptic inputs. We show how this predictive learning rule could act at single synaptic connections and through diffuse neuromodulatory systems."

In particular, we show how activity in the cerebral cortex can make predictions about future receipt of reward and how fluctuations in the activity levels of neurons in diffuse dopamine systems above and below baseline levels would represent errors in these predictions that are delivered to cortical and subcortical targets. We present a model for how such errors could be constructed in a real brain that is consistent with physiological results for a subset of dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral tegmental area and surrounding dopaminergic neurons. The theory also makes testable predictions about human choice behavior on a simple decision-making task. Furthermore, we show that, through a simple influence on synaptic plasticity, fluctuations in dopamine release can act to change the predictions in an appropriate manner."

However, serious methodological problems accompany such studies. Pharmacological controls are necessary to assess non‐receptor‐mediated local actions of the drug, anatomical controls are necessary to rule out drug efflux to distal sites of action, and behavioral controls are necessary to separate rewarding from general activating effects of drugs. Five brain sites have been advanced as sites of rewarding opiate actions: the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens septi (NAS), lateral hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and hippocampus. Current evidence appears to confirm two of these—VTA and NAS; evidence is currently incomplete in the case of the hippocampus and is conflicting in the case of the lateral hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray. Two sites have been advanced as sites of rewarding psychomotor stimulant actions: NAS and the frontal cortex; each site seems implicated, but puzzling differences between amphetamine and cocaine findings remain to be resolved. Each of the clearly implicated sites is local to dopamine cell bodies or dopamine terminals that have been implicated in the rewarding effects of brain stimulation, food, and sex."

Wise,1982.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Neuroleptic drugs disrupt the learning and performance of operant habits motivated by a variety of positive reinforcers, including food, water, brain stimulation, intravenous opiates, stimulants, and barbiturates. This disruption has been demonstrated in several kinds of experiments with doses that do not significantly limit normal response capacity. With continuous reinforcement neuroleptics gradually cause responding to cease, as in extinction or satiation. This pattern is not due to satiation, however, because it also occurs with nonsatiating reinforcement (such as saccharin or brain stimulation). Repeated tests with neuroleptics result in earlier and earlier response cessation reminiscent of the kind of decreased resistance to extinction caused by repeated tests without the expected reward. Indeed, withholding reward can have the same effect on responding under later neuroleptic treatment as prior experience with neuroleptics themselves; this suggests that there is a transfer of learning (really unlearning) from nonreward to neuroleptic conditions. These tests under continuous reinforcement schedules suggest that neuroleptics blunt the ability of reinforcers to sustain responding at doses which largely spare the ability of the animal to initiate responding. Animals trained under partial reinforcement, however, do not respond as well during neuroleptic testing as animals trained under continuous reinforcement. Thus, neuroleptics can also impair responding (though not response<jats:italic>capacity</jats:italic>) that is normally sustained by environmental stimuli (and associated expectancies) in the absence of the primary reinforcer. Neuroleptics also blunt the euphoric impact of amphetamine in humans. These data suggest that the most subtle and interesting effect of neuroleptics is a selective attenuation of motivational arousal which is (a) critical for goal-directed behavior, (b) normally induced by reinforcers and associated environmental stimuli, and (c) normally accompanied by the subjective experience of pleasure. Because these drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and because they cause parkinsonian-like side effects, this action has implications for a better understanding of human pathology as well as normal motivational processes."

The dopamine receptor blocker pimozide antagonized the establishment of conditioning. However, the same dose of pimozide, when given to previously conditioned animals on the placebo test day, failed to antagonize the expression of conditioned activity. Thus, during conditioning dopaminergic neurons mediated a change that subsequently influenced behavior even when dopaminergic systems were blocked. Although schizophrenia may be related to hyperfunctioning of dopamine, neuroleptic drugs, which block dopamine receptors on their first administration, do not have therapeutic effects for a number of days. The results of the pimozide experiments may resolve this paradox."

First, the incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that most cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments, and, second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells. The rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer IVc, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields with circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or from the right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below IVc, most cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In a binocular cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions in the two retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more effective than the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance are seen. These two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the cortex, in that cells with common physiological properties are grouped together in vertically organized systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all cells respond preferentially to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods it has been shown that these columns have the form of vertically disposed alternating left-eye and right-eye slabs, which in horizontal section form alternating stripes about 400 μm thick, with occasional bifurcations and blind endings. Cells of like orientation specificity are known from physiological recordings to be similarly grouped in much narrower vertical sheeet-like aggregations, stacked in orderly sequences so that on traversing the cortex tangentially one normally encounters a succession of small shifts in orientation, clockwise or counterclockwise; a 1 mm traverse is usually accompanied by one or several full rotations through 180°, broken at times by reversals in direction of rotation and occasionally by large abrupt shifts. A full complement of columns, of either type, left-plus-right eye or a complete 180° sequence, is termed a hypercolumn. Columns (and hence hypercolumns) have roughly the same width throughout the binocular part of the cortex. The two independent systems of hypercolumns are engrafted upon the well known topographic representation of the visual field. The receptive fields mapped in a vertical penetration through cortex show a scatter in position roughly equal to the average size of the fields themselves, and the area thus covered, the aggregate receptive field, increases with distance from the fovea. A parallel increase is seen in reciprocal magnification (the number of degrees of visual field corresponding to 1 mm of cortex). Over most or all of the striate cortex a movement of 1-2 mm, traversing several hypercolumns, is accompanied by a movement through the visual field about equal in size to the local aggregate receptive field. Thus any 1-2 mm block of cortex contains roughly the machinery needed to subserve an aggregate receptive field. In the cortex the fall-off in detail with which the visual field is analysed, as one moves out from the foveal area, is accompanied not by a reduction in thickness of layers, as is found in the retina, but by a reduction in the area of cortex (and hence the number of columnar units) devoted to a given amount of visual field: unlike the retina, the striate cortex is virtually uniform morphologically but varies in magnification. In most respects the above description fits the newborn monkey just as well as the adult, suggesting that area 17 is largely genetically programmed. The ocular dominance columns, however, are not fully developed at birth, since the geniculate terminals belonging to one eye occupy layer IVc throughout its length, segregating out into separate columns only after about the first 6 weeks, whether or not the animal has visual experience. If one eye is sutured closed during this early period the columns belonging to that eye become shrunken and their companions correspondingly expanded. This would seem to be at least in part the result of interference with normal maturation, though sprouting and retraction of axon terminals are not excluded."

However, while this framework is of essential importance for robotics and well understood from an analytical point of view, it can be prohibitively hard to achieve accurate control in the face of modeling errors, which are inevitable in complex robots (e.g. humanoid robots). In this paper, we suggest a learning approach for operational-space control as a direct inverse model learning problem. A first important insight for this paper is that a physically correct solution to the inverse problem with redundant degrees of freedom does exist when learning of the inverse map is performed in a suitable piecewise linear way. The second crucial component of our work is based on the insight that many operational-space controllers can be understood in terms of a constrained optimal control problem. The cost function associated with this optimal control problem allows us to formulate a learning algorithm that automatically synthesizes a globally consistent desired resolution of redundancy while learning the operational-space controller. From the machine learning point of view, this learning problem corresponds to a reinforcement learning problem that maximizes an immediate reward. We employ an expectation-maximization policy search algorithm in order to solve this problem. Evaluations on a three degrees-of-freedom robot arm are used to illustrate the suggested approach. The application to a physically realistic simulator of the anthropomorphic SARCOS Master arm demonstrates feasibility for complex high degree-of-freedom robots. We also show that the proposed method works in the setting of learning resolved motion rate control on a real, physical Mitsubishi PA-10 medical robotics arm. "

We exercise the algorithms on speech and image data, and compare performance with PCA and with neural network implementations of nonlinear PCA. We find that both nonlinear techniques can provide more accurate representations than PCA and show that the local linear techniques outperform neural network implementations. "

A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention.

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.

Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text."

            Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10
            <jats:sup>6</jats:sup>
            optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.

The preprocessor performs a word-level normalization by fitting a model of the word structure using the EM algorithm. Words are then coded into low resolution ""annotated images"" where each pixel contains information about trajectory direction and curvature. The recognizer is a convolution network that can be spatially replicated. From the network output, a hidden Markov model produces word scores. The entire system is globally trained to minimize word-level errors. "

Martin,1993.0,"<jats:p> Visual object recognition is often conceived of as a final step in a visual processing system, First, physical information in the raw image is used to isolate and enhance to-be-recognized clumps and then each of the resulting preprocessed representations is fed into the recognizer. This general conception fails when there are no reliable physical cues for isolating the objects, such as when objects overlap. This paper describes an approach, called centered object integrated segmentation and recognition (COISR), for integrating object segmentation and recognition within a single neural network. The application is handprinted character recognition. The approach uses a backpropagation network that scans a field of characters and is trained to recognize whether it is centered over a single character or between characters. When it is centered over a character, the net classifies the character. The approach is tested on a dataset of handprinted digits and high accuracy rates are reported. "

Local learning algorithms attempt to locally adjust the capacity of the training system to the properties of the training set in each area of the input space. The family of local learning algorithms contains known methods, like the k-nearest neighbors method (kNN) or the radial basis function networks (RBF), as well as new algorithms. A single analysis models some aspects of these algorithms. In particular, it suggests that neither kNN or RBF, nor nonlocal classifiers, achieve the best compromise between locality and capacity. A careful control of these parameters in a simple local learning algorithm has provided a performance breakthrough for an optical character recognition problem. Both the error rate and the rejection performance have been significantly improved. "

This study, however, demonstrates that these networks, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and k nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifiers, all provide similar low error rates on a large handwritten digit database. The backpropagation network is overall superior in memory usage and classification time but can provide “false positive” classifications when the input is not a digit. The backpropagation network also has the longest training time. The RBF classifier requires more memory and more classification time, but less training time. When high accuracy is warranted, the RBF classifier can generate a more effective confidence judgment for rejecting ambiguous inputs. The simple kNN classifier can also perform handwritten digit recognition, but requires a prohibitively large amount of memory and is much slower at classification. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the algorithm and fast training characteristics makes the kNN classifier an attractive candidate in hardware-assisted classification tasks. These results on a large, high input dimensional problem demonstrate that practical constraints including training time, memory usage, and classification time often constrain classifier selection more strongly than small differences in overall error rate.

Jordan; Satinder P. Singh,1994.0,"<jats:p> Recent developments in the area of reinforcement learning have yielded a number of new algorithms for the prediction and control of Markovian environments. These algorithms, including the TD(λ) algorithm of Sutton (1988) and the Q-learning algorithm of Watkins (1989), can be motivated heuristically as approximations to dynamic programming (DP). In this paper we provide a rigorous proof of convergence of these DP-based learning algorithms by relating them to the powerful techniques of stochastic approximation theory via a new convergence theorem. The theorem establishes a general class of convergent algorithms to which both TD(λ) and Q-learning belong. "

Indications that sleep participates in the consolidation of fresh memory traces come from a wide range of experimental observations. At the network level, reactivations during sleep of neuronal assemblies recently challenged by new environmental circumstances have been reported in different experimental designs. These neuronal assemblies are proposed to be involved in the processing of memory traces during sleep.

Ungerleider,2007.0,"<jats:p>Repeated experience with a visual stimulus can result in improved perception of the stimulus, i.e., perceptual learning. To understand the underlying neural mechanisms of this process, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to track brain activations during the course of training on a contrast discrimination task. Based on their ability to improve on the task within a single scan session, subjects were separated into two groups: “learners” and “nonlearners.” As learning progressed, learners showed progressively reduced activation in both visual cortex, including Brodmann's areas 18 and 19 and the fusiform gyrus, and several cortical regions associated with the attentional network, namely, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), frontal eye field (FEF), and supplementary eye field. Among learners, the decrease in brain activations in these regions was highly correlated with the magnitude of performance improvement. Unlike learners, nonlearners showed no changes in brain activations during training. Learners showed stronger activation than nonlearners during the initial period of training in all these brain regions, indicating that one could predict from the initial activation level who would learn and who would not. In addition, over the course of training, the functional connectivity between IPS and FEF in the right hemisphere with early visual areas was stronger for learners than nonlearners. We speculate that sharpened tuning of neuronal representations may cause reduced activation in visual cortex during perceptual learning and that attention may facilitate this process through an interaction of attention-related and visual cortical regions."

Therefore, the investigation of neural mechanisms underlying reward functions requires behavioral theories that can conceptualize the different effects of rewards on behavior. The scientific investigation of behavioral processes by animal learning theory and economic utility theory has produced a theoretical framework that can help to elucidate the neural correlates for reward functions in learning, goal-directed approach behavior, and decision making under uncertainty. Individual neurons can be studied in the reward systems of the brain, including dopamine neurons, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum. The neural activity can be related to basic theoretical terms of reward and uncertainty, such as contiguity, contingency, prediction error, magnitude, probability, expected value, and variance. "

Although hoping to unravel a single dopamine function underlying these phenomena, electrophysiological and neurochemical studies still give a confusing, mutually exclusive, and partly contradictory account of dopamine's role in behavior. However, the speed of observed phasic dopamine changes varies several thousand fold, which offers a means to differentiate the behavioral relationships according to their time courses. Thus dopamine is involved in mediating the reactivity of the organism to the environment at different time scales, from fast impulse responses related to reward via slower changes with uncertainty, punishment, and possibly movement to the tonic enabling of postsynaptic motor, cognitive, and motivational systems deficient in Parkinson's disease.

Andersen; Christopher A. Buneo,2002.0,"<jats:p>▪ Abstract  The posterior parietal cortex (PPC), historically believed to be a sensory structure, is now viewed as an area important for sensory-motor integration. Among its functions is the forming of intentions, that is, high-level cognitive plans for movement. There is a map of intentions within the PPC, with different subregions dedicated to the planning of eye movements, reaching movements, and grasping movements. These areas appear to be specialized for the multisensory integration and coordinate transformations required to convert sensory input to motor output. In several subregions of the PPC, these operations are facilitated by the use of a common distributed space representation that is independent of both sensory input and motor output. Attention and learning effects are also evident in the PPC. However, these effects may be general to cortex and operate in the PPC in the context of sensory-motor transformations."

Colby; Michael E. Goldberg,1999.0,"<jats:p>▪ Abstract  The space around us is represented not once but many times in parietal cortex. These multiple representations encode locations and objects of interest in several egocentric reference frames. Stimulus representations are transformed from the coordinates of receptor surfaces, such as the retina or the cochlea, into the coordinates of effectors, such as the eye, head, or hand. The transformation is accomplished by dynamic updating of spatial representations in conjunction with voluntary movements. This direct sensory-to-motor coordinate transformation obviates the need for a single representation of space in environmental coordinates. In addition to representing object locations in motoric coordinates, parietal neurons exhibit strong modulation by attention. Both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of attention contribute to the enhancement of visual responses. The saliance of a stimulus is the primary factor in determining the neural response to it. Although parietal neurons represent objects in motor coordinates, visual responses are independent of the intention to perform specific motor acts."

All data were obtained from rhesus monkeys trained to perform a direction discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. The conditions for such a comparison were ideal in that both psychophysical and physiological data were obtained in the same animals, on the same sets of trials, and using the same visual display. In addition, the psychophysical task was tailored in each experiment to the physiological properties of the neuron under study; the visual display was matched to each neuron's preference for size, speed, and direction of motion. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of most MT neurons was very similar to the psychophysical sensitivity of the animal observers. In fact, the responses of single neurons typically provided a satisfactory account of both absolute psychophysical threshold and the shape of the psychometric function relating performance to the strength of the motion signal. Thus, psychophysical decisions in our task are likely to be based upon a relatively small number of neural signals. These signals could be carried by a small number of neurons if the responses of the pooled neurons are statistically independent. Alternatively, the signals may be carried by a much larger pool of neurons if their responses are partially intercorrelated."

We have now used numerical simulations to try to understand how neural signals in area MT support psychophysical decisions. We developed a model that pools neuronal responses drawn from our physiological data set and compares average responses in different pools to produce psychophysical decisions. The structure of the model allows us to assess the relationship between “neuronal” input signals and simulated psychophysical performance using the same methods we have applied to real experimental data. We sought to reconcile three experimental observations: psychophysical performance (threshold sensitivity to motion stimuli embedded in noise), a trial-by-trial covariation between the neural response and the monkey's choices, and a modest correlation between pairs of MT neurons in their variable responses to identical visual stimuli. Our results can be most accurately simulated if psychophysical decisions are based on pools of at least 100 weakly correlated sensory neurons. The neurons composing the pools must include a broader range of sensitivities than we encountered in our MT recordings, presumably because of the inclusion of neurons whose optimal stimulus is different from the one being discriminated. Central sources of noise degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of the pooled signal, but this degradation is relatively small compared with the noise typically carried by single cortical neurons. This suggests that our monkeys base near-threshold psychophysical judgments on signals carried by populations of weakly interacting neurons; these populations include many neurons that are not tuned optimally for the particular stimuli being discriminated."

Thus, rhesus monkeys were trained in a visual categorization task designed to minimize rote learning of individual exemplars and to allow testing of transfer from old to novel exemplars of the category. The stimuli were presented during controlled fixation. The monkeys learned to distinguish complex colour images of trees from other objects and generalized from old to novel exemplars. An extensive series of tests with probe stimuli showed that simple form, colour and texture features had insufficient stimulus control to account for the categorization performance. Scrambling the images impaired categorization performance, suggesting that the configuration of stimulus components controlled the categorization. The animals also learned a fish/non‐fish categorization, but more slowly than a tree/non‐tree categorization. These results indicate that rhesus monkeys can learn to categorize socially neutral, complex, natural visual images and suggest that this categorization is based on a combination of low‐level features."

Although most neurons responded to trees and non‐trees, about a quarter responded in a category‐specific manner, e.g. to trees but not non‐trees, and about one‐tenth responded almost exclusively to exemplars of the trained category. The responses of these neurons were largely invariant for stimulus transformations, e.g. changes in position or size, and decreased with the degree of image scrambling, mimicking the behavioural results. However, the responses of single neurons were insufficiently stimulus invariant to accommodate the entire range of variability present in the features of exemplars within the same category.

L. Sheinberg; N. K. Logothetis,1997.0,"<jats:p>The visual areas of the temporal lobe of the primate are thought to be essential for the representation of visual objects. To examine the role of these areas in the visual awareness of a stimulus, we recorded the activity of single neurons in monkeys trained to report their percepts when viewing ambiguous stimuli. Visual ambiguity was induced by presenting incongruent images to the two eyes, a stimulation condition known to instigate binocular rivalry, during which one image is seen at a given time while the other is perceptually suppressed. Previous recordings in areas V1, V2, V4, and MT of monkeys experiencing binocular rivalry showed that only a small proportion of striate and early extrastriate neurons discharge exclusively when the driving stimulus is seen. In contrast, the activity of almost all neurons in the inferior temporal cortex and the visual areas of the cortex of superior temporal sulcus was found to be contingent upon the perceptual dominance of an effective visual stimulus. These areas thus appear to represent a stage of processing beyond the resolution of ambiguities—and thus beyond the processes of perceptual grouping and image segmentation—where neural activity reflects the brain’s internal view of objects, rather than the effects of the retinal stimulus on cells encoding simple visual features or shape primitives."

Sheinberg; Nikos K. Logothetis,2001.0,"<jats:p>During natural vision, the brain efficiently processes views of the external world as the eyes actively scan the environment. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying this process, we recorded the activity of individual temporal cortical neurons while monkeys looked for and identified familiar targets embedded in natural scenes. We found a group of visual neurons that exhibited stimulus-selective neuronal bursts just before the monkey's response. Most of these cells showed similar selectivity whether effective targets were viewed in isolation or encountered in the course of exploring complex scenes. In addition, by embedding target stimuli in natural scenes, we could examine the activity of these stimulus-selective cells during visual search and at the time targets were fixated and identified. We found that, during exploration, neuronal activation sometimes began shortly before effective targets were fixated, but only if the target was the goal of the next fixation. Furthermore, we found that the magnitude of this early activation varied inversely with reaction time, indicating that perceptual information was integrated across fixations to facilitate recognition. The behavior of these visually selective cells suggests that they contribute to the process of noticing familiar objects in the real world."

Here, we show a robust correlation of neuronal discharges between the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus on both slow and fine time scales in the mouse and rat. Neuronal bursts in deep cortical layers, associated with sleep spindles and delta waves/slow rhythm, effectively triggered hippocampal discharges related to fast (ripple) oscillations.

Cells that fired together when the animal occupied particular locations in the environment exhibited an increased tendency to fire together during subsequent sleep, in comparison to sleep episodes preceding the behavioral tasks. Cells that were inactive during behavior, or that were active but had non-overlapping spatial firing, did not show this increase. This effect, which declined gradually during each post-behavior sleep session, may result from synaptic modification during waking experience. Information acquired during active behavior is thus re-expressed in hippocampal circuits during sleep, as postulated by some theories of memory consolidation."

Wilson,2010.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The hippocampus plays a key role in the acquisition of new memories for places and events. Evidence suggests that the consolidation of these memories is enhanced during sleep. At the neuronal level, reactivation of awake experience in the hippocampus during sharp‐wave ripple events, characteristic of slow‐wave sleep, has been proposed as a neural mechanism for sleep‐dependent memory consolidation. However, a causal relation between sleep reactivation and memory consolidation has not been established. Here we show that disrupting neuronal activity during ripple events impairs spatial learning. We trained rats daily in two identical spatial navigation tasks followed each by a 1‐hour rest period. After one of the tasks, stimulation of hippocampal afferents selectively disrupted neuronal activity associated with ripple events without changing the sleep‐wake structure. Rats learned the control task significantly faster than the task followed by rest stimulation, indicating that interfering with hippocampal processing during sleep led to decreased learning. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."

A widely held model assumes that this is because newly encoded memories undergo covert reactivation during sleep. We cued new memories in humans during sleep by presenting an odor that had been presented as context during prior learning, and so showed that reactivation indeed causes memory consolidation during sleep. Re-exposure to the odor during slow-wave sleep (SWS) improved the retention of hippocampus-dependent declarative memories but not of hippocampus-independent procedural memories. Odor re-exposure was ineffective during rapid eye movement sleep or wakefulness or when the odor had been omitted during prior learning. Concurring with these findings, functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant hippocampal activation in response to odor re-exposure during SWS."

New studies have shown that place cells are part of a broader circuit for dynamic representation of self-location. A key component of this network is the entorhinal grid cells, which, by virtue of their tessellating firing fields, may provide the elements of a path integration–based neural map. Here we review how place cells and grid cells may form the basis for quantitative spatiotemporal representation of places, routes, and associated experiences during behavior and in memory. Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.

Diamond,2012.0,"<jats:p>To investigate how hippocampal neurons encode sound stimuli, and the conjunction of sound stimuli with the animal's position in space, we recorded from neurons in the CA1 region of hippocampus in rats while they performed a sound discrimination task. Four different sounds were used, two associated with water reward on the right side of the animal and the other two with water reward on the left side. This allowed us to separate neuronal activity related to sound identity from activity related to response direction. To test the effect of spatial context on sound coding, we trained rats to carry out the task on two identical testing platforms at different locations in the same room. Twenty-one percent of the recorded neurons exhibited sensitivity to sound identity, as quantified by the difference in firing rate for the two sounds associated with the same response direction. Sensitivity to sound identity was often observed on only one of the two testing platforms, indicating an effect of spatial context on sensory responses. Forty-three percent of the neurons were sensitive to response direction, and the probability that any one neuron was sensitive to response direction was statistically independent from its sensitivity to sound identity. There was no significant coding for sound identity when the rats heard the same sounds outside the behavioral task. These results suggest that CA1 neurons encode sound stimuli, but only when those sounds are associated with actions."

Collins,1996.0,"<jats:p>A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is    that there is no uncertainty in the world: the planner has full    knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and    the outcome of every action is fully predictable.  These planners    cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which    different actions are performed in different circumstances.  In this    paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and    construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a    partial-order contingency planner.  Cassandra uses explicit    decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide    which plan branch to follow.  The decision-steps in a plan result in    subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way    as any other subgoals.  Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of    gathering information from the process of making decisions.  The    explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent    approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid    base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making    procedures."

The states of this internal process are not directly observable by the controller; rather, he has available a set of observable outputs that are only probabilistically related to the internal state of the system. The formulation is illustrated by a simple machine-maintenance example, and other specific application areas are also discussed. The paper demonstrates that, if there are only a finite number of control intervals remaining, then the optimal payoff function is a piecewise-linear, convex function of the current state probabilities of the internal Markov process. In addition, an algorithm for utilizing this property to calculate the optimal control policy and payoff function for any finite horizon is outlined. These results are illustrated by a numerical example for the machine-maintenance problem. "

The state space for the problem is the space of state occupancy probability distributions (the unit simplex). The development of the algorithm introduces several new ideas, including the class of finitely transient policies, which are shown to possess piecewise linear cost functions. The paper develops easily implemented approximations to stationary policies based on these finitely transient policies and shows that the concave hull of an approximation can be included in the well-known Howard policy improvement algorithm with subsequent convergence. The paper closes with a detailed example illustrating the application of the algorithm to the two-state partially observable Markov process. "

The cortex was studied using single-unit recording from sites between 3 and 6 mm from the infusion cannulae. One week of D,L-APV infusion coincident with monocular deprivation or “reverse suture” produced a concentration-dependent increase in the percentage of neurons that (1) lacked normal orientation selectivity and (2) were responsive to stimulation of the deprived eye. These effects outlasted the presence of the drug in the tissue. APV treatment also prevented the acquisition of selectivity and visual responsiveness that normally results from monocular visual experience after dark-rearing. Lasting effects of chronic APV infusion were not observed in adult striate cortex. The effects of APV on kitten striate cortex depended on the presence of the D stereoisomer as infusion of L-APV was without effect. Estimates of extracellular concentration using 3H-APV indicated that significant effects could be obtained with concentrations as low as 20 microM D,L-APV. Recordings from units during infusion indicated that visual responses were reduced by APV. Nonetheless, a normal percentage of visually responsive neurons was found at sites greater than or equal to 3 mm from the infusion cannula. There was no evidence that chronic APV infusion affected the sampling frequency of recorded neurons or disrupted cytoarchitecture at the sites further than 3 mm from the infusion cannula. Taken together, the data indicate that the effects of APV on kitten striate cortex are likely due specifically to the blockade of NMDA receptors. These data are considered in relation to several hypotheses concerning the role of NMDA receptors in the experience-dependent development of striate cortex."

We present a model for how the disparity selectivity of cortical neurons might arise during development. The model is based on Hebbian mechanisms for plasticity at synapses between geniculocortical neurons and cortical cells. The model is driven by correlated activity in retinal ganglion cells within each eye before birth and additionally between eyes after birth. With no correlations present between the eyes, the cortical model developed only monocular cells. Adding a small amount of correlation between eyes at the beginning of development produced cortical neurons that were entirely binocular and tuned to zero disparity. However, if an initial phase of purely same-eye correlations was followed by a second phase of development that included correlations between eyes, the cortical model became populated with both monocular and binocular cells. Moreover, in the two-phase model, binocular cells tended to be selective for zero disparity, whereas the more monocular cells tended to have nonzero disparity. This relationship between ocular dominance and disparity has been observed in the visual cortex of the cat by other workers. Differences in the relative timing of the two developmental phases could account for the higher proportion of monocular cells found in the visual cortices of other animals."

A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further."

Since the seminal work, first of Cajal and later of Hebb, the synapse is thought to be the basic ""storing unit."" Hebb proposed that information is stored by correlation: synapses between neurons, which are often coactive, are enhanced. Several recent findings suggest that such a mechanism is indeed operative in the central nervous system. Pairing of activity on presynaptic fibers with strong postsynaptic depolarization results in synaptic enhancement. While there is substantial evidence in favor of a postsynaptic locus for detection of the synchronous pre- and postsynaptic event and subsequent initiation of synaptic enhancement, the locus of this enhancement and its ensuing persistence is still disputed: both pre- and postsynaptic contributions have been suggested. In all previous studies, the enhancement was presumed to be specific to the synapses where synchronous pre- and postsynaptic stimulation was applied. We report here that two recording techniques--optical recording, using voltage-sensitive dyes, and double intracellular recordings--reveal that synaptic enhancement is not restricted to the stimulated cell. Although we paired single afferent volleys with intracellular stimulation confined to one postsynaptic cell, we found that strengthening also occurred on synapses between the stimulated presynaptic fibers and neighboring cells. This suggests that synaptic enhancement by the ""paired-stimulation paradigm"" is not local on the presynaptic axons and that, in fact, the synapses of many neighboring postsynaptic cells are enhanced."

Exposure of the tectum to the active isomer of APV produces desegregation of the RGC terminals without blocking electrical activity in the afferents or altering their terminal arbor morphology. Exposure to the inactive isomer of APV causes no perturbation of the normal stripe pattern. APV-induced desegregation is completely reversible within 2 weeks of removal of the APV. In addition, exposure of the optic tectum to NMDA results in stripes with sharper borders and fewer forks and fusions than untreated animals.

Their nervous systems are relatively small and contain many individually identifiable cells. The CNS is highly compartmentalized with clear separations between multisensory higher order neuropiles in the brain and neuropiles serving sensory-motor routines in the ventral cord (Huber, 1974). The rich behavior of insects includes orientation in space and time, visual, chemical, and mechanical communication, and complex motor routines for flying, walking, swimming, nest building, defense, and attack. Learning and memory, though, are not usually considered to be a strong point of insects. Rather, insect behavior is often regarded as highly stereotyped and under tight control of genetically programmed neural circuits. This view, however, does not do justice to the insect order of Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants). Most Hymenopteran species care for their brood either as individual females or as a social group of females. Consequently, they regularly return to their nest site to feed, protect, and nurse the larvae, store food, and hide from adverse environmental conditions. Since they search for food (prey; nectar and pollen on flowers) at unpredictable sites, they have to learn the celestial and terrestrial cues that guide their foraging trips over long distances and allow them to find their nest sites (central place foraging; von Frisch, 1967; Seeley, 1985). They learn to relate the sun's position and sky pattern of polarized light to the time of the day (Lindauer, 1959), and landmarks are learned in relationship to the nest site within the framework of the time- compensated sun compass. The honeybee communicates direction and distance of a feeding place to hive mates by performing a ritualized body movement, the waggle dance (von Frisch, 1967). Associative learning is an essential component of the bee's central place foraging behavior and dance communication. Hive mates attending a dance performance learn the odor emanating from the dancing bee and seek it at the indicated food site. The odor, color, and shape of flowers are learned when the bee experiences these stimuli shortly before it finds food (nectar, pollen). This appetitive learning in bees has many characteristics of associative learning well known from mammalian learning studies (Menzel, 1985, 1990; Bitterman, 1988). It follows the rules of classical and operant conditioning, respectively, so that stimuli or behavioral acts are associated with evaluating stimuli. Since associative learning, especially of the classical type, is well described at the phenomenological and operational level (Rescorla, 1988), it provides a favorable approach in the search for the neural substrate underlying learning and memory.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The specific computational rules used by organisms will often be evolutionarily adaptive by generating higher probabilities of survival, reproduction, and resource acquisition. Experiments with enclosed colonies of bumblebees constrained to foraging on artificial flowers suggest that the bumblebee's cognitive architecture is designed to efficiently exploit floral resources from spatially structured environments given limits on memory and the neuronal processing of information. A non-linear relationship between the biomechanics of nectar extraction and rates of net energetic gain by individual bees may account for sensitivities to both the arithmetic mean and variance in reward distributions in flowers. Heuristic rules that lead to efficient resource exploitation may also lead to subjective misperception of likelihoods. Subjective probability formation may then be viewed as a problem in pattern recognition subject to specific sampling schemes and memory constraints."
10.2307/1936663,[],0.656053,Uncertainty and Pollinator‐Plant Interactions: The Foraging Behavior of Bees and Wasps on Artificial Flowers,Leslie A. Real,1981.0,"<jats:p>The influence of variability in nectar reward per flower on the foraging behavior of individual bumblebees (Bombus sandersoni Fkln.) and paper wasps (Vespula vulgaris L.) was explored during late summer 1979. The area around each colony was enclosed in mosquito netting, and an artificial floral patch, yellow and blue cardboard squares randomly mixed and fixed beneath wells in a clear sheet of plexiglass, was established within the enclosure. The nectar reward per flower (i.e., the volume) was manipulated to generate different degrees of variability within a floral type. The first set of experiments had equal quantities of nectar in all yellow and blue flowers. Individual foraging bees showed a significant preference for yellow. However, when blue flowers were kept constant (2 μL in each) and yellow made variable (6 μL in every third flower and none in the remainder), individual foragers avoided the variable yellow even though the expected reward from yellow was equal to blue. As a control, the variable floral type was reversed with yellow now constant. Individual foragers then showed an equally strong avoidance of blue flowers. In order to insure that bees were avoiding uncertainty rather than merely avoiding empty flowers, a new set of experiments was run with some nectar in every flower. The constant floral type contained 2 μL of nectar in every flower while the variable type contained 5 μL in every third and .5 μL in the remainder. Again the foragers preferred the constant floral type; however, the preference was not as great as when there were empty flowers. Analysis of the sequence of visits made by individual forages seems to indicate that bees learned to distinguish the variable floral type during the foraging bout. Similar experiments were run on the wasps. When flowers were of equal quality, the wasps preferred yellow to blue. When one floral type was variable and the other constant, the wasps preferred the constant type. For the same magnitude of variability, however, the bumblebee's avoidance of the variable floral type was more pronounced than was the wasps' response. The results of these experiments are then analyzed within the context of a more general model of foraging behavior in variable environments."

Among other effects, dopamine excites many of the pyloric constrictor (PY) neurons to fire at high frequency and phase-advances the timing of their activity in the motor pattern. These responses arise in part from direct actions of dopamine to modulate the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the PY cells, and can be studied in synaptically isolated neurons. The rate of rebound following a hyperpolarizing prestep and the spike frequency during a subsequent depolarization are both accelerated by dopamine. Based on theoretical simulations, Hartline (1979) suggested that the rate of postinhibitory rebound in stomatogastric neurons could vary with the amount of voltage- sensitive transient potassium current (IA). Consistent with this prediction, we found that dopamine evokes a net conductance decrease in synaptically isolated PY neurons. In voltage clamp, dopamine reduces IA, specifically by reducing the amplitude of the slowly inactivating component of the current and shifting its voltage activation curve in the depolarized direction. 4-Aminopyridine, a selective blocker of IA in stomatogastric neurons, mimics and occludes the effects of dopamine on isolated PY neurons. A conductance-based mathematical model of the PY neuron shows appropriate changes in activity upon quantitative modification of the IA parameters affected by dopamine. These results demonstrate that dopamine excites and phase-advances the PY neurons in the rhythmic pyloric motor pattern at least in part by reducing the transient K+ current, IA."

Monkeys that had previously learned a simple reaction time task were trained to perform a spatial delayed response task via two intermediate tasks. During the learning of each new task, a total of 25% of 76 dopamine neurons showed phasic responses to the delivery of primary liquid reward, whereas only 9% of 163 neurons responded to this event once task performance was established. This produced an average population response during but not after learning of each task. Reward responses during learning were significantly more numerous and pronounced in area A10, as compared to areas A8 and A9. Dopamine neurons also showed phasic responses to the two conditioned stimuli. These were the instruction cue, which was the first stimulus in each trial and indicated the target of the upcoming arm movement (58% of 76 neurons during and 44% of 163 neurons after learning), and the trigger stimulus, which was a conditioned incentive stimulus predicting reward and eliciting a saccadic eye movement and an arm reaching movement (38% of neurons during and 40% after learning). None of the dopamine neurons showed sustained activity in the delay between the instruction and trigger stimuli that would resemble the activity of neurons in dopamine terminal areas, such as the striatum and frontal cortex. Thus, dopamine neurons respond phasically to alerting external stimuli with behavioral significance whose detection is crucial for learning and performing delayed response tasks. The lack of sustained activity suggests that dopamine neurons do not encode representational processes, such as working memory, expectation of external stimuli or reward, or preparation of movement. Rather, dopamine neurons are involved with transient changes of impulse activity in basic attentional and motivational processes underlying learning and cognitive behavior."

Previous studies have shown that dopamine (DA) neurons respond to stimuli of behavioral significance, such as primary reward and conditioned stimuli predicting reward and eliciting behavioral reactions. The present study investigated how these responses develop and vary when the behavioral significance of stimuli changes during different stages of learning. Impulses from DA neurons were recorded with movable microelectrodes from areas A8, A9, and A10 in two awake monkeys during the successive acquisition of two behavioral tasks. Impulses of DA neurons were distinguished from other neurons by their long duration (1.8-5.0 ms) and low spontaneous frequency (0.5-7.0 imp/s). 2. In the first task, animals learned to reach in a small box in front of them when it opened visibly and audibly. Before conditioning, DA neurons were activated the first few times that the empty box opened and animals reacted with saccadic eye movements. Neuronal and behavioral responses disappeared on repeated stimulus presentation. Thus neuronal responses were related to the novelty of an unexpected stimulus eliciting orienting behavior. 3. Subsequently, the box contained a small morsel of apple in one out of six trials. Animals reacted with ocular saccades to nearly every box opening and reached out when the morsel was present. One-third of 49 neurons were phasically activated by every door opening. The response was stronger when food was present. Thus DA neurons responded simultaneously to the sight of primary food reward and to the conditioned stimulus associated with reward. 4. When the box contained a morsel of apple on every trial, animals regularly reacted with target-directed eye and arm movements, and the majority of 76 DA neurons responded to door opening. The same neurons lacked responses to a light not associated with task performance that was illuminated at the position of the food box in alternate sessions, thus demonstrating specificity for the behavioral significance of stimuli. 5. The second task employed the operant conditioning of a reaction time situation in which animals reached from a resting key toward a lever when a small light was illuminated. DA neurons lacked responses to the unconditioned light. During task acquisition lasting 2-3 days, one-half of 25 DA neurons were phasically activated when a drop of liquid reward was delivered for reinforcing the reaching movement. In contrast, neurons were not activated when reward was delivered at regular intervals (2.5-3.5 s) but a task was not performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

Four groups of neurons contained cholinergic perikarya and were designated as Chl‐Ch4. The Ch1 group corresponds to the medial septal nucleus; about 10% of its neurons are cholinergic, and it provides a substantial projection to the hippocampus. The Ch2 group corresponds to the vertical nucleus of the diagonal band; at least 70% of its neurons are cholinergic, and it is the major source of innervation that the hippocampus and hypothalamus receive from the Chl‐Ch4 complex. The Ch3 group most closely corresponds to the horizontal nucleus of the diagonal band; only 1% of its neurons can definitely be shown to be cholinergic, and it is the major source of Chl‐Ch4 projections to the olfactory bulb. The Ch4 group most closely corresponds to the nucleus basalis of Meynert; at least 90% of its neurons are cholinergic, and it has projections to widespread areas of cortex and to the amygdala. In fact, the Ch4 group provides the single major source of cholinergic innervation for the entire cortical surface. In this respect, it is analogous to the raphe nuclei and to the nucleus locus coeruleus, which constitute the major sources of widespread cortical serotonergic and nor‐adrenergic innervation, respectively.<jats:p>The extensive Ch4 group can be divided into several subdivisions.

We investigated the role of 2 specific outputs of the forebrain limbic system, the tegmental pedunculopontine nucleus (TPP) and the periacqueductal gray (PAG) of the pons-midbrain, in the positive motivational effects of morphine and amphetamine. We now report that the TPP, but not the PAG nor other nearby regions, is a critical site in the neural system subserving the rewarding effects of both opiates and stimulants. Bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the TPP blocked the positive reinforcing effects of both morphine and amphetamine in naive rats as measured in a conditioned place preference paradigm. However, TPP lesioned animals were still capable of acquiring a conditioned place preference to an environment paired with the peripheral opiate antagonist methylnaltrexone. This suggested that TPP lesions did not cause nonspecific deficits in the basic learning mechanisms underlying conditioned place preferences. Furthermore, while the TPP was critical for the acquisition of a conditioned preference to an environment paired with morphine in naive rats, rats that had acquired a morphine conditioned place preference prior to the lesions were capable of retaining and demonstrating these place preferences after lesions of the TPP. This again demonstrates that TPP lesions are producing an unconditioned deficit in motivation rather than a deficit in learning or memory. Finally, direct comparisons of the place preference data of individual animals with their correspondent TPP lesion sites indicated that the most effective lesions overlapped to a greater degree TPP perikarya with descending, rather than ascending, axons. This suggests that motivational information generated by drug stimuli acting at “upstream” neural structures flows in a descending direction through the TPP region of the brain stem. These results suggest that opiates and stimulants must ultimately activate a single brain-stem substrate in order to have a positive motivational impact. It is hypothesized that the neural circuits mediating the rewarding effects of drug stimuli acting at forebrain sites exit the limbic system in the TPP region of the brain stem, where motivation may ultimately influence or be isomorphic with the elicitation of motor responses subserving approach and exploration."

Challenge by a narcotic antagonist produced no signs of physical dependence. Dependence was not seen after long-term morphine infusions into the ventral tegmentum but was seen after similar infusions into the periventricular gray region. Thus a major rewarding property of morphine is independent of the drug's ability to produce physical dependence. These data challenge models of drug addiction that propose physical dependence as necessary for the rewarding effects of opioids.

Withdrawal from morphine resulted in a marked reduction of extracellular DA concentrations from control values at 1, 2, 3, and 5 days of withdrawal. After 7 days of withdrawal, DA output was less, but still significantly, reduced. Challenge with morphine resulted in stimulation of DA output in controls (maximum, 35%), no effect on the first day of withdrawal, and stimulation similar to controls’ on days 2 and 7 of withdrawal. On day 5 and, particularly, on day 3 of withdrawal, morphine‐induced stimulation of DA output was markedly potentiated (maximum, 100 and 160%, respectively). Changes in the sensitivity of DA transmission to morphine challenge were associated with changes in the behavioral stimulant effects of morphine, with tolerance on day 1 and marked sensitization on days 3 and 5 but also on day 7, when morphine‐induced stimulation of transmission was no longer potentiated. The results indicate that repeated morphine administration induces a state of dependence in DA neurons and a short‐lasting tolerance followed by an increased sensitivity to its stimulant effects on DA transmission. These changes might play an important role in the development of opiate addiction and in the maintenance of opiate self‐administration in dependent subjects."

Braestrup; M. Nielsen; J. Scheel‐Krüger,1974.0,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract—</jats:bold> A new combined ion‐exchange and thin‐layer‐chromatographic procedure is described which separates and measures quantitatively, after intraventricular injection of [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]dopamine (DA), the rat brain content of labelled noradrenaline (NA) and the following labelled noradrenaline metabolites: free 3‐methoxy‐4‐hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MOPEG), conjugated MOPEG, free plus conjugated dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DOPEG), vanillic mandelic acid (VMA) and normetanephrine (NM). Labelled dopamine and its metabolites were also measured. The time‐course study performed from 5 min to 24 h after [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]DA showed that MOPEG and DOPEG, mainly as conjugates, are major NA metabolites whereas VMA is a very insignificant NA metabolite in the rat brain. A very rapid initial increase of [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]NM, free MOPEG and conjugated MOPEG was found during the time interval where the [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]NA biosynthesis is very high (0–15 min). This combined with the finding that these metabolites stabilize at lower levels during the [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]NA ‘storage phase’ (9–24 h) provides a strong indication that newly synthesized NA preferentially is metabolized. Our measurements of endogenous NA, free MOPEG and conjugated MOPEG provide additional support. The injections of various decreasing doses of [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]DA (3·08–0·0010 μg) showed that the proportions of total [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]MOPEG and total [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]DOPEG to [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]NA were constant after all [<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]DA doses investigated.

Endogenous stores of norepinephrine (NE) were first labeled by the microinjection of [14C]NE into these circumscribed sites. Subsequently, [14C]NE release was examined by repeated perfusions of an artificial cerebrospinal fluid through a push-pull cannula at the rate of 23 mul/min for 5-10 min every 30 min. After successive control perfusates were collected, food or water was given to the animal. During an interval of feeding, a significant efflux of [14C]NE and its metabolites occurred reliably from midline structures of the hypothalamus at the level of the ventromedial nucleus. Although the feeding-related output of [14C]NE detected within the anterior hypothalamus was lower, [14C]NE was also released from this region when the rat pressed a lever to obtain food pellets. These results support the view that endogenous catecholamines underlie, at least partially, diencephalic mechanisms controlling food intake, including sensory, motor, or motivational components. "

Moore,1978.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this study the location of dopamine (DA) neuron perikarya in the rostral mesencephalon of the rat was determined using the glyoxylic acid fluorescence histochemical technique. Subsequently the topography of the projection of these mesencephalic neurons on the basal forebrain and striatum was analyzed using the anterograde transport‐autoradiographic tracing method and the retrograde transport‐horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. The results of these anatomical studies were correlated with the biochemical and histochemical studies presented in previous reports (Moore, 1978; Fallon and Moore, 1978; Fallon et al., 1978) to provide the following conclusions. The topography of the DA neuron projection on the basal forebrain and neostriatum is organized in three planes, dorsal‐ventral, medial‐lateral and anterior‐posterior. DA cells are found almost exclusively in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Ventral cells of the SN and VTA project to the dorsal structures of the basal forebrain such as the septum, nucleus accumbens and neostriatum. The latter includes some DA cells located ventrally in the pars reticulata of the SN. Dorsal cells project to ventral structures. The medial‐lateral topography is organized such that the medial sectors of the SN‐VTA area project to the medial parts of nuclei in the basal forebrain and neostriatum whereas lateral sectors of the SN‐VTA area project to the lateral parts of nuclei in the basal forebrain and neostriatum. An anterior‐posterior topography also is evident such that anterior parts of the SN‐VTA project anteriorly whereas the posterior SN‐VTA projects more posteriorly in these areas. These observations are consistent with the view that the DA neurons of the SN‐VTA complex form a single nuclear group with a highly topographically organized projection innervating not only deep nuclei of the telencephalon but allocortical structures as well."

The word alliesthesia is proposed to describe this phenomenon. It is, in itself, an adequate motivation for behavior such as food intake or thermoregulation. Therefore, negative regulatory feedback systems, based upon oropharingeal or cutaneous thermal signals are peripheral only in appearance, since the motivational component of the sensation is of internal origin. The internal signals seem to be complex and related to the set points of some regulated variables of the ""milieu interieur,"" like set internal temperature in the case of thermal sensation. Alliesthesia can therefore explain the adaptation of these behaviors to their goals. Only three sensations have been studied— thermal, gustatory, and olfactory, but it is probable that alliesthesia also exists in such simple ways as in bringing a signal, usually ignored, to the subject's attention. For example, gastric contractions, not normally perceived, are felt in the state of hunger. Since alliesthesia relies on an internal input, it is possible that alliesthesia exists only with sensations related to some constants of the ""milieu interieur"" and therefore would not exist in visual or auditory sensations. As a matter of fact, luminous or auditory stimuli can be pleasing or displeasing in themselves, but there seems to be little variation of pleasure in these sensations, that is, no alliesthesia. There may be some esthetic value linked to these stimuli but it is a striking coincidence that they are in themselves rather neutral and that it is difficult to imagine a constant of the ""milieu interieur"" which could be possibly modified by a visual or an auditive stimulus—such as light of a certain wavelength or sound of a given frequency.
          <jats:p>In the light of this theory, it is possible to reconsider the nature of the whole conscious experience. The existence of alliesthesia implies the presence of internal signals modifying the conscious sensations aroused from peripheral receptors. It is therefore necessary to question the existence of sensations aroused by direct stimulation of central receptors, such as hypothalamic temperature detectors, osmoreceptors, and others. Does their excitation arouse sensations of their own, or does the sensation have to pass through peripheral senses? Only human experimentation could answer this question. In the same way, it is possible that self-stimulation of the brain is pleasant, not by giving a sensation in itself, but because the electrical stimulus, renders peripheral stimuli pleasant."

Robinson,1981.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>It is traditionally believed that cerebral activation (the presence of low voltage fast electrical activity in the neocortex and rhythmical slow activity in the hippocampus) is correlated with arousal, while deactivation (the presence of large amplitude irregular slow waves or spindles in both the neocortex and the hippocampus) is correlated with sleep or coma. However, since there are many exceptions, these generalizations have only limited validity. Activated patterns occur in normal sleep (active or paradoxical sleep) and during states of anesthesia and coma. Deactivated patterns occur, at times, during normal waking, or during behavior in awake animals treated with atropinic drugs. Also, the fact that patterns characteristic of sleep, arousal, and waking behavior continue in decorticate animals indicates that reticulo-cortical mechanisms are not essential for these aspects of behavior.<jats:p>These puzzles have been largely resolved by recent research indicating that there are two different kinds of input from the reticular activating system to the hippocampus and neocortex. One input is probably cholinergic; it may play a role in stimulus control of behavior. The second input is noncholinergic and appears to be related to motor activity; movement-related input to the neocortex may be dependent on a trace amine.<jats:p>Reticulo-cortical systems are not related to arousal in the traditional sense, but may play a role in the control of adaptive behavior by influencing the activity of the cerebral cortex, which in turn exerts control over subcortical circuits that co-ordinate muscle activity to produce behavior."

The strength of this framework lay in providing concepts and methods for studying the effects of hedonic (reinforcing) stimuli on the repetition of specified responses acquired in instrumental training situations of various kinds. Its weakness lay in the invalidity of its central assumptions, stimulus-response association and response-reinforcement, which could not deal with motor-equivalence and flexibility (or “intelligence”) in behavior. To the four decades of incisive criticism on particular theoretical and empirical grounds, a more comprehensive challenge to the response-reinforcement framework is now added by the newer ideas about the nature of cognitive, motivational, and response-production processes that have emerged from the work of ethologists, neuroscientists, and cognitive psychologists. An alternative framework, incorporating the newer ideas, is clearly needed.<jats:p>The particular framework proposed here is based on the ideas of perceptual learning of stimulus-stimulus correlations and of a motivational (rather than reinforcing) role of hedonic (incentive) stimuli. According to it, an act is produced when its act-assembly is activated by a pexgo (perceptual representation) of a certain eliciting stimulus complex (ES). When certain eliciting stimuli are correlated with incentive stimuli, they acquire motivational properties that serve to strengthen the pexgos generated by those eliciting stimuli and thereby increase the probability of activation of the corresponding act-assemblies. Motivation thus influences response production, not by directly instigating “existing” responses, but by modulating the strength of pexgos of eliciting stimuli for the succession of acts that comprise a response. Therefore, a response is always constructed afresh on the basis of current perceptions; not even a stable and stereotyped response occurs as a mere activation of a preformed motor program. The topography of any response that emerges is determined by the nature of the motivational state and the momentary spatiotemporal distribution of eliciting stimuli of changing motivational valence.<jats:p>By suggesting that the animal learns the overlapping and nested correlations between the stimulus events that commonly occur in a given situation, and by separating what is learned from the processes of response production, the proposed perceptual-motivational framework seems capable of dealing with the problems of motor equivalence and flexibility in adaptive behavior. Some implications of this approach for further behavioral and brain research on such problems as behavior modification, learning by observation of models, analysis of causality, and search for neural substrates of learning and response production, are outlined."

A detailed theory of cerebellar cortex is proposed whose consequence is that the cerebellum learns to perform motor skills. Two forms of input—output relation are described, both consistent with the cortical theory. One is suitable for learning movements (actions), and the other for learning to maintain posture and balance (maintenance reflexes).<jats:p>2. It is known that the cells of the inferior olive and the cerebellar Purkinje cells have a special one‐to‐one relationship induced by the climbing fibre input. For learning actions, it is assumed that:<jats:p>(<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>) each olivary cell responds to a cerebral instruction for an elemental movement. Any action has a defining representation in terms of elemental movements, and this representation has a neural expression as a sequence of firing patterns in the inferior olive; and<jats:p>(<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>) in the correct state of the nervous system, a Purkinje cell can initiate the elemental movement to which its corresponding olivary cell responds.<jats:p>3. Whenever an olivary cell fires, it sends an impulse (via the climbing fibre input) to its corresponding Purkinje cell. This Purkinje cell is also exposed (via the mossy fibre input) to information about the context in which its olivary cell fired; and it is shown how, during rehearsal of an action, each Purkinje cell can learn to recognize such contexts. Later, when the action has been learnt, occurrence of the context alone is enough to fire the Purkinje cell, which then causes the next elemental movement. The action thus progresses as it did during rehearsal.<jats:p>4. It is shown that an interpretation of cerebellar cortex as a structure which allows each Purkinje cell to learn a number of contexts is consistent both with the distributions of the various types of cell, and with their known excitatory or inhibitory natures. It is demonstrated that the mossy fibre‐granule cell arrangement provides the required pattern discrimination capability.<jats:p>5. The following predictions are made.<jats:p>(<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>) The synapses from parallel fibres to Purkinje cells are facilitated by the conjunction of presynaptic and climbing fibre (or post‐synaptic) activity.<jats:p>(<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>) No other cerebellar synapses are modifiable.<jats:p>(<jats:italic>c</jats:italic>) Golgi cells are driven by the greater of the inputs from their upper and lower dendritic fields.<jats:p>6. For learning maintenance reflexes, 2(<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>) and 2(<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>) are replaced by<jats:p>2′. Each olivary cell is stimulated by one or more receptors, all of whose activities are usually reduced by the results of stimulating the corresponding Purkinje cell.<jats:p>7. It is shown that if (2′) is satisfied, the circuit receptor → olivary cell → Purkinje cell → effector may be regarded as a stabilizing reflex circuit which is activated by learned mossy fibre inputs. This type of reflex has been called a learned conditional reflex, and it is shown how such reflexes can solve problems of maintaining posture and balance.<jats:p>8. 5(<jats:italic>a</jats:italic>), and either (2) or (2′) are essential to the theory: 5(<jats:italic>b</jats:italic>) and 5(<jats:italic>c</jats:italic>) are not absolutely essential, and parts of the theory could survive the disproof of either."
10.1098/rspb.1970.0040,[],0.673914,A theory for cerebral neocortex,,1970.0,"<jats:p>It is proposed that the learning of many tasks by the cerebrum is based on using a very few fundamental techniques for organizing information. It is argued that this is made possible by the prevalence in the world of a particular kind of redundancy, which is characterized by a ‘Fundamental Hypothesis’. This hypothesisis used to found a theory of the basic operations which, it is proposed, are carried out by the cerebral neocortex. They involve the use of past experience to form so-called ‘classificatory units’ with which to interpret subsequent experience. Such classificatory units are imagined to be created whenever either something occurs frequently in the brain’s experience, or enough redundancy appears in the form of clusters of slightly differing inputs. A(non-Bayesian) information theoretic account is given of the diagnosis of an input as an instance of an existing classificatory unit, and of the interpretation as such of an incompletely specified input. Neural models are devised to implement the two operations of diagnosis and interpretation, and it is found that the performance of the second is an automatic consequence of the model’s ability to perform the first. The discovery and formation of new classificatory units is discussed within the context of these neural models. It is shown how a climbing fibre input (of the kind described by Cajal) to the correct cell can cause that cell to perform a mountain-climbing operation in an underlying probability space, that will lead it to respond to a class of events for which it is appropriate to code. This is called the ‘spatial recognizer effect’. The structure of the cerebral neocortex is reviewed in the light of the model which the theory establishes. It is found that many elements in the cortex have a natural identification with elements in the model. This enables many predictions, with specified degrees of firmness, to be made concerning the connexions and synapses of the following cortical cells and fibres: Martinotti cells; cerebral granule cells; pyramidal cells of layers III, V and II; short axon cells of all layers, especially I, IV and VI; cerebral climbing fibres and those cells of the cortex which give rise to them; cerebral basket cells; fusiform cells of layers VI and VII. It is shown that if rather little information about the classificatory units to be formed has been coded genetically, it may be necessary to use a technique called codon formation to organize structure in a suitable way to represent a new unit. It is shown that under certain conditions, it is necessary to carry out a part of this organization during sleep. A prediction is made about the effect of sleep on learning of a certain kind."

The topography of area 17 was similar to that found in other mammals: the upper visual field projected posteriorly, the most nasal part mapped onto the lateral border. Here the projection did not end at the vertical meridian passing through the animal's long axis, but proceeded for at least 10° into the ipsilateral hemifield of vision, so that at least 20° of visual field were represented in both hemispheres.

Layer 4 was the only layer in which simple cells showed end‐inhibition (a reduction in response to slits extending beyond the excitatory portion of the receptive field).<jats:p>4. The standard complex cells were found in all layers, but were quite scarce in layer 4. As with the simple cells, field size varied with layer: in layer 2+3 they had small to intermediate field sizes, in layer 5 intermediate, and in layer 6 very large. Layer 6 cells showed summation for slits of increased length up to very large values, and responded best when the slits were centred in the receptive field.<jats:p>The only standard complex cells that showed end‐inhibition were those in layer 2+3, and these were similar to the layer 4 simple cells in terms of proportion of end‐inhibited units and degree of end‐inhibition.<jats:p>5. The special complex cells, originally described by Palmer &amp; Rosenquist (1974), were found in two tiers: the upper one at the layer 3/layer 4 border and the lower one in layer 5. They were different from the standard complex cells in having a high spontaneous activity, high velocity preference, and large fields which were similar in size (at a given eccentricity) from one cell to the next. Many showed reduced response to slits of increasing length, even for slits that did not extend beyond the borders of the responsive region.<jats:p>6. Cells in layer 6 (the origin of the corticogeniculate projection) were antidromically activated from the lateral geniculate nucleus. The antidromically activated units included both simple and complex cells, and they had the long receptive fields characteristic of the overall population of cells in layer 6.<jats:p>7. The results showed that there are different types of simple and complex cells, and that cells in different layers have different properties. Taken together with their differences in site of projection, this demonstrates that the anatomical lamination pattern is reflected in functional differences between cells in different layers."

The optic fibers were thereby traced to their known terminations and to a small thalamic cell cluster to which we found no reference in the literature.

Only the peripheral segments cross laminar borders. The smallest (class 3) cells have long stalked appendages and give rise to intrinsic axons which ramify close to the perikaryon.

Guillery,1972.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>It has been shown previously that, in kittens, geniculate laminae that are visually deprived by a unilateral lid‐suture grow less than normal. However, cell growth is affected only where the deprived laminae lie opposite a normally innervated lamina. The most lateral part of lamina A, which is innervated from the monocular crescent of the visual field and which extends beyond the edge of lamina A1, is not affected by lid‐suture. One interpretation of this result is that a binocular competition controls geniculate cell growth and that the normal competitive balance is upset by the lid‐suture.<jats:p>In order to test this interpretation further, four kittens had the lids of one eye sutured and in the other eye a patch of temporal retina was destroyed. After 5.5 to 12 weeks′ survival lamina A1 showed a patch of transneuronal degeneration produced by the ipsilateral retinal lesion. Most of lamina A showed a reduced cell growth contralateral to the suture. However, the part of this lamina lying opposite the zone of transneuronal degeneration contained cells that were larger than would be expected if there were no competitive effect. These results show that geniculate cells compete during development, probably for available synaptic surfaces upon cortical cells, perhaps in terms of interlaminar inhibitory mechanisms. Success in this competition depends upon the nature of the visual input. The present results provide no evidence that visual deprivation can change geniculate cell growth by any direct, non‐competitive effect."

The lateral parts, which extend beyond the border of lamina A1 and which project to the monocular parts of the visual cortex showed no change. These results show that some geniculate cells are not affected by deprivation. The observations are consistent with the view that during normal development geniculate cell axons from adjacent laminae compete with each other for synaptic surfaces upon binocular cortical neurons: that unilateral lid suture upsets the balance of this competition and that the reduced perikaryal growth in the lateral geniculate nucleus is secondary to the unbalanced axonal development, which occurs in the binocular portions of the geniculocortical projection but which cannot occur in the monocular portions, where there is no competition."

Initial studies have demonstrated that multilayer networks with time delays can provide excellent discrimination between small sets of pre-segmented difficult-to-discriminate words, consonants, and vowels. Performance for these small vocabularies has often exceeded that of more conventional approaches. Physiological front ends have provided improved recognition accuracy in noise and a cochlea filter-bank that could be used in these front ends has been implemented using micro-power analog VLSI techniques. Techniques have been developed to scale networks up in size to handle larger vocabularies, to reduce training time, and to train nets with recurrent connections. Multilayer perceptron classifiers are being integrated into conventional continuous-speech recognizers. Neural net architectures have been developed to perform the computations required by vector quantizers, static pattern classifiers, and the Viterbi decoding algorithm. Further work is necessary for large-vocabulary continuous-speech problems, to develop training algorithms that progressively build internal word models, and to develop compact VLSI neural net hardware.

Using this parameter, the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes are analyzed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for feasible learnability.

          <JATS1:p>Attention and Motor Skill Learning challenges traditional views that the method of learning a motor skill involves focusing attention on each part of the skill and internalizing proper execution. Instead, author Gabriele Wulf argues that the learning of new motor skills suffers when attentional focus is on the coordination of movements. When attention is directed to the desired movement effect, however, performance levels rise. Not only is a higher level of performance often achieved faster with an external rather than an internal attention focus, but the skill is retained better. The advantages of external focus apply to a variety of skills and skill levels and may be used while instructing athletes, children, and those with physical impairments as well as in any setting in which effective and efficient training of motor skills is a concern.</JATS1:p>

               <jats:p>This paper describes a self-organizing neural model for eye-hand coordination. Called the DIRECT model, it embodies a solution of the classical motor equivalence problem. Motor equivalence computations allow humans and other animals to flexibly employ an arm with more degrees of freedom than the space in which it moves to carry out spatially defined tasks under conditions that may require novel joint configurations. During a motor babbling phase, the model endogenously generates movement commands that activate the correlated visual, spatial, and motor information that are used to learn its internal coordinate transformations. After learning occurs, the model is capable of controlling reaching movements of the arm to prescribed spatial targets using many different combinations of joints. When allowed visual feedback, the model can automatically perform, without additional learning, reaches with tools of variable lengths, with clamped joints, with distortions of visual input by a prism, and with unexpected perturbations. These compensatory computations occur within a single accurate reaching movement. No corrective movements are needed. Blind reaches using internal feedback have also been simulated. The model achieves its competence by transforming visual information about target position and end effector position in 3-D space into a body-centered spatial representation of the direction in 3-D space that the end effector must move to contact the target. The spatial direction vector is adaptively transformed into a motor direction vector, which represents the joint rotations that move the end effector in the desired spatial direction from the present arm configuration. Properties of the model are compared with psychophysical data on human reaching movements, neurophysiological data on the tuning curves of neurons in the monkey motor cortex, and alternative models of movement control."

Recently it has been pointed out how noninvariant results may, in general, be obtained by applying these techniques to other areas of robotics, namely hybrid control and inverse ve locity kinematics. Unfortunately, the problems are not restricted to just these particular areas in robotics but are connected with misleading definitions of the metric properties of the six- dimensional wrench and twist vector spaces used in robotics. The current definitions lead to inconsistent results (i.e., results that are not invariant with respect to changes in the reference frame andlor changes in the dimensional units used to express the problem. As a matter of fact, given a linear systemu = Ax, where the matrix A may be singular, the Moore-Penrose theory of generalized inverses may be properly and directly applied only when the vector space U of vectoru and the vector space X of vector x are inner product spaces. Arbitrary assignment of Euclidean inner products to the space U and X when the vectorsu andx have elements with different physical units can lead to inconsistent and noninvariant results.

Eminently readable, it is written as an introduction to analytical dynamics, with emphasis on fundamental concepts in mechanics. The connection between generalized inverses of matrices and constrained motion is a central theme. The book begins with a description of the motion of a particle subjected to holonomic and nonholonomic constraints and presents explicit equations of motion.

At its core, it employs nonparametric regression with locally linear models. In order to stay computationally efficient and numerically robust, each local model performs the regression analysis with a small number of univariate regressions in selected directions in input space in the spirit of partial least squares regression. We discuss when and how local learning techniques can successfully work in high-dimensional spaces and review the various techniques for local dimensionality reduction before finally deriving the LWPR algorithm. The properties of LWPR are that it (1) learns rapidly with second-order learning methods based on incremental training, (2) uses statistically sound stochastic leave-one-out cross validation for learning without the need to memorize training data, (3) adjusts its weighting kernels based on only local information in order to minimize the danger of negative interference of incremental learning, (4) has a computational complexity that is linear in the number of inputs, and (5) can deal with a large number of—possibly redundant—inputs, as shown in various empirical evaluations with up to 90 dimensional data sets. For a probabilistic interpretation, predictive variance and confidence intervals are derived. To our knowledge, LWPR is the first truly incremental spatially localized learning method that can successfully and efficiently operate in very high-dimensional spaces. "

The dynamical behavior of natural gradient online learning is analyzed and is proved to be Fisher efficient, implying that it has asymptotically the same performance as the optimal batch estimation of parameters. This suggests that the plateau phenomenon, which appears in the backpropagation learning algorithm of multilayer perceptrons, might disappear or might not be so serious when the natural gradient is used.

In this paper we introduce GPOMDP, a simulation-based algorithm for    generating a biased estimate of the gradient of the average reward in    Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes POMDPs controlled by    parameterized stochastic policies. A similar algorithm was proposed by    (Kimura et al. 1995). The algorithm's chief advantages are that it    requires storage of only twice the number of policy parameters, uses    one free beta (which has a natural interpretation in terms of    bias-variance trade-off), and requires no knowledge of the underlying    state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP, and show how the correct choice    of the parameter beta is related to the mixing time of the    controlled POMDP. We briefly describe extensions of GPOMDP to    controlled Markov chains, continuous state, observation and control    spaces, multiple-agents, higher-order derivatives, and a version for    training stochastic policies with internal states.  In a companion    paper (Baxter et al., this volume) we show how the gradient estimates    generated by GPOMDP can be used in both a traditional stochastic    gradient algorithm and a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local    optima of the average reward."

How are these movements planned? A minimum acceleration criterion has been examined in the past, and the solution obtained, based on the Euler-Poisson equation, failed to predict that the hand would begin and end the movement at rest (i.e., with zero acceleration). Therefore, this criterion was rejected in favor of the minimum jerk, which was proved to be successful in describing many features of human movements. This letter follows an alternative approach and solves the minimum acceleration problem with constraints using Pontryagin's minimum principle. We use the minimum principle to obtain minimum acceleration trajectories and use the jerk as a control signal. In order to find a solution that does not include nonphysiological impulse functions, constraints on the maximum and minimum jerk values are assumed. The analytical solution provides a three-phase piecewise constant jerk signal (bang-bang control) where the magnitude of the jerk and the two switching times depend on the magnitude of the maximum and minimum available jerk values. This result fits the observed trajectories of reaching movements and takes into account both the extrinsic coordinates and the muscle limitations in a single framework. The minimum acceleration with constraints principle is discussed as a unifying approach for many observations about the neural control of movements. "

The main thesis of this article, how-ever,is that there is a disconnect between research in simulation optimization—which has addressed the stochastic nature of discrete-event simulation by concentratingon theoretical results of convergence and specialized algorithms that are mathematically elegant—and the recent software developments, which implement very general algorithms adopted from techniques in the deterministic optimization metaheuristic literature (e.g., genetic algorithms, tabu search, artificial neural networks).

Glynn,1990.0,"<jats:p>Consider a computer system having a CPU that feeds jobs to two input/output (I/O) devices having different speeds. Let θ be the fraction of jobs routed to the first I/O device, so that 1 - θ is the fraction routed to the second. Suppose that α = α(θ) is the steady-sate amount of time that a job spends in the system. Given that θ is a decision variable, a designer might wish to minimize α(θ) over θ. Since α(·) is typically difficult to evaluate analytically, Monte Carlo optimization is an attractive methodology. By analogy with deterministic mathematical programming, efficient Monte Carlo gradient estimation is an important ingredient of simulation-based optimization algorithms. As a consequence, gradient estimation has recently   attracted considerable attention in the simulation community. It is our goal, in this article, to describe one efficient method for estimating gradients in the Monte Carlo setting, namely the likelihood ratio method (also known as the efficient score method). This technique has been previously described (in less general settings than those developed in this article) in [6, 16, 18, 21]. An alternative gradient estimation procedure is infinitesimal perturbation analysis; see [11, 12] for an introduction. While it is typically more difficult to apply to a given application than the likelihood ratio technique of interest here, it often turns out to be statistically more accurate.
          <jats:p>In this article, we first describe two important problems which motivate our study of efficient  gradient estimation algorithms. Next, we will present the likelihood ratio gradient estimator in a general setting in which the essential idea is most transparent. The section that follows then specializes the estimator to discrete-time stochastic processes. We derive likelihood-ratio-gradient estimators for both time-homogeneous and non-time homogeneous discrete-time Markov chains. Later, we discuss likelihood ratio gradient estimation in continuous time. As examples of our analysis, we present the gradient estimators for time-homogeneous continuous-time Markov chains; non-time homogeneous continuous-time Markov chains; semi-Markov processes; and generalized semi-Markov processes. (The analysis throughout these sections assumes the performance measure that defines α(θ)  corresponds to a terminating simulation.) Finally, we conclude the article with a brief discussion of the basic issues that arise in extending the likelihood ratio gradient estimator to steady-state performance measures."

While    the assumptions and perspectives adopted in these areas often differ    in substantial ways, many planning problems of interest to researchers    in these fields can be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs)    and analyzed using the techniques of decision theory.       This paper presents an overview and synthesis of MDP-related methods,    showing how they provide a unifying framework for modeling many    classes of planning problems studied in AI. It also describes    structural properties of MDPs that, when exhibited by particular    classes of problems, can be exploited in the construction of optimal    or approximately optimal policies or plans.  Planning problems    commonly possess structure in the reward and value functions used to    describe performance criteria, in the functions used to describe state    transitions and observations, and in the relationships among features    used to describe states, actions, rewards, and observations.       Specialized representations, and algorithms employing these    representations, can achieve computational leverage by exploiting    these various forms of structure.  Certain AI techniques -- in    particular those based on the use of structured, intensional    representations -- can be viewed in this way.  This paper surveys    several types of representations for both classical and    decision-theoretic planning problems, and planning algorithms that    exploit these representations in a number of different ways to ease    the computational burden of constructing policies or plans.  It focuses    primarily on abstraction, aggregation and decomposition techniques    based on AI-style representations."
10.1613/jair.639,[],0.659976,Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with the MAXQ Value Function Decomposition,T. G. Dietterich,2000.0,"<jats:p>This paper presents a new approach to hierarchical    reinforcement learning based on decomposing the target Markov decision    process (MDP) into a hierarchy of smaller MDPs and decomposing the    value function of the target MDP into an additive combination of the    value functions of the smaller MDPs.  The decomposition, known as the    MAXQ decomposition, has both a procedural semantics---as a subroutine    hierarchy---and a declarative semantics---as a representation of the    value function of a hierarchical policy.  MAXQ unifies and extends    previous work on hierarchical reinforcement learning by Singh,    Kaelbling, and Dayan and Hinton.  It is based on the assumption that    the programmer can identify useful subgoals and define subtasks that    achieve these subgoals.  By defining such subgoals, the programmer    constrains the set of policies that need to be considered during    reinforcement learning.  The MAXQ value function decomposition can    represent the value function of any policy that is consistent with the    given hierarchy.  The decomposition also creates opportunities to    exploit state abstractions, so that individual MDPs within the    hierarchy can ignore large parts of the state space.  This is    important for the practical application of the method.  This paper    defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its    representational power, and establishes five conditions for the safe    use of state abstractions.  The paper presents an online model-free    learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges with    probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a    recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of    state abstraction.  The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and    MAXQ-Q through a series of experiments in three domains and shows    experimentally that MAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a    recursively optimal policy much faster than flat Q learning.  The fact    that MAXQ learns a representation of the value function has an    important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and execute an    improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the    policy improvement step of policy iteration.  The paper demonstrates    the effectiveness of this non-hierarchical execution experimentally.    Finally, the paper concludes with a comparison to related work and a    discussion of the design tradeoffs in hierarchical reinforcement learning."

The book makes four main contributions to the fields of machine learning and multiagent systems. First, it describes an architecture within which a flexible team structure allows member agents to decompose a task into flexible roles and to switch roles while acting. Second, it presents layered learning, a general-purpose machine-learning method for complex domains in which learning a mapping directly from agents' sensors to their actuators is intractable with existing machine-learning methods. Third, the book introduces a new multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm—team-partitioned, opaque-transition reinforcement learning (TPOT-RL)—designed for domains in which agents cannot necessarily observe the state-changes caused by other agents' actions. The final contribution is a fully functioning multiagent system that incorporates learning in a real-time, noisy domain with teammates and adversaries—a computer-simulated robotic soccer team. Peter Stone's work is the basis for the CMUnited Robotic Soccer Team, which has dominated recent RoboCup competitions. RoboCup not only helps roboticists to prove their theories in a realistic situation, but has drawn considerable public and professional attention to the field of intelligent robotics. The CMUnited team won the 1999 Stockholm simulator competition, outscoring its opponents by the rather impressive cumulative score of 110-0.

The error is measured by the entropic loss. It is proved that the generalization error converges to H<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>, the entropy of the conditional distribution of the true machine, as H<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> + m<jats:sup>*</jats:sup>/(2t), while the training error converges as H<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> - m<jats:sup>*</jats:sup>/(2t), where t is the number of examples and m<jats:sup>*</jats:sup> shows the complexity of the network. When the model is faithful, implying that the true machine is in the model, m<jats:sup>*</jats:sup> is reduced to m, the number of modifiable parameters. This is a universal law because it holds for any regular machine irrespective of its structure under the maximum likelihood estimator. Similar relations are obtained for the Bayes and Gibbs learning algorithms. These learning curves show the relation among the accuracy of learning, the complexity of a model, and the number of training examples. "

NLPCA, like PCA, is used to identify and remove correlations among problem variables as an aid to dimensionality reduction, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. While PCA identifies only linear correlations between variables, NLPCA uncovers both linear and nonlinear correlations, without restriction on the character of the nonlinearities present in the data. NLPCA operates by training a feedforward neural network to perform the identity mapping, where the network inputs are reproduced at the output layer. The network contains an internal “bottleneck” layer (containing fewer nodes than input or output layers), which forces the network to develop a compact representation of the input data, and two additional hidden layers. The NLPCA method is demonstrated using time‐dependent, simulated batch reaction data. Results show that NLPCA successfully reduces dimensionality and produces a feature space map resembling the actual distribution of the underlying system parameters."

This way of combining individual “expert” models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called “contrastive divergence” whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data. "

               <jats:p>We have developed a near-real-time computer system that can locate and track a subject's head, and then recognize the person by comparing characteristics of the face to those of known individuals. The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as ""eigenfaces,"" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

This procedure takes a set of input/output pattern pairs and attempts to learn their functional relationship; it develops the necessary representational features during the course of learning. A series of computer simulation studies was carried out to assess the ability of these networks to accurately label sounds, to learn to recognize sounds without labels, and to learn feature representations of continuous speech. These studies demonstrated that the networks can learn to label presegmented test tokens with accuracies of up to 95%. Networks trained on segmented sounds using a strategy that requires no external labels were able to recognize and delineate sounds in continuous speech. These networks developed rich internal representations that included units which corresponded to such traditional distinctions as vowels and consonants, as well as units that were sensitive to novel and nonstandard features. Networks trained on a large corpus of unsegmented, continuous speech without labels also developed interesting feature representations, which may be useful in both segmentation and label learning. The results of these studies, while preliminary, demonstrate that backpropagation learning can be used with complex, natural data to identify a feature structure that can serve as the basis for both analysis and nontrivial pattern recognition."

Sejnowski,1995.0,"<jats:p> We derive a new self-organizing learning algorithm that maximizes the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in ""blind"" signal processing. "

            The human visual process can be studied by examining the computational problems associated with deriving useful information from retinal images. In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria,
            <jats:italic>accessibility, scope and uniqueness</jats:italic>
            , and
            <jats:italic>stability and sensitivity</jats:italic>
            , are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation’s design are considered, (i) the representation’s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape’s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described.

There are several different techniques for loading the CM AC memory depending on the amount of data which has already been stored and the degree of accuracy which is desired. The CM AC system lends itself to a “natural” partitioning of the control problem into manageable subproblems. At each level the CM AC controller translates commands from the next higher level into sequences of instructions to the next lower level. Data storage, or training, is accomplished first at the lowest level and must be completed, or nearly so, at each level before it can be initiated at the next higher level."

Results indicated that one dimension of personality, Conscientiousness, showed consistent relations with all job performance criteria for all occupational groups. For the remaining personality dimensions, the estimated true score correlations varied by occupational group and criterion type. Extraversion was a valid predictor for two occupations involving social interaction, managers and sales (across criterion types). Also, both Openness to Experience and Extraversion were valid predictors of the training proficiency criterion (across occupations). Other personality dimensions were also found to be valid predictors for some occupations and some criterion types, but the magnitude of the estimated true score correlations was small (ρ &lt; .10). Overall, the results illustrate the benefits of using the 5‐factor model of personality to accumulate and communicate empirical findings.

They develop in the mind on the basis of an innate endowment that permits the growth of rich and highly articulated structures along an intrinsically determined course under the triggering and partially shaping effect of experience, which fixes parameters in an intricate system of predetermined form. It is argued that the mind is modular in character, with a diversity of cognitive structures, each with its specific properties arid principles. Knowledge of language, of the behavior of objects, and much else crucially involves these mental structures, and is thus not characterizable in terms of capacities, dispositions, or practical abilities, nor is it necessarily grounded in experience in the standard sense of this term.<jats:p>Various types of knowledge and modes of knowledge acquisition are discussed in these terms. Some of the properties of the language faculty are investigated. The basic cognitive relation is “knowing a grammar”; knowledge of language is derivative and, correspondingly, raises further problems. Language as commonly understood is not a unitary phenomenon but involves a number of interacting systems: the “computational” system of grammar, which provides the representations of sound and meaning that permit a rich range of expressive potential, is distinct from a conceptual system with its own properties; knowledge of language must be distinguished from knowledge of how to use a language; and the various systems that enter into the knowledge and use of language must be further analyzed into their specific subcomponents."

According to the latter, mental processes have access only to formal (nonsemantic) properties of the mental representations over which they are defined.<jats:p>The following claims are defended: (1) That the traditional dispute between “rational” and “naturalistic” psychology is plausibly viewed as an argument about the status of the computational theory of mind. Rational psychologists accept a formality condition on the specification of mental processes; naturalists do not. (2) That to accept the formality condition is to endorse a version of methodological solipsism. (3) That the acceptance of some such condition is warranted, at least for that part of psychology which concerns itself with theories of the mental causation of behavior. This is because: (4) such theories require nontransparent taxonomies of mental states; and (5) nontransparent taxonomies individuate mental states without reference to their semantic properties. Equivalently, (6) nontransparent taxonomies respect the way that the organism represents the object of its propositional attitudes to<jats:italic>itself</jats:italic>, and it is this representation which functions in the causation of behavior.<jats:p>The final section of the paper considers the prospect for a naturalistic psychology: one which defines its generalizations over relations between mental representations and their environmental causes, thus seeking to account for the semantic properties of propositional attitudes.

Whereas interactionism stresses the continuity of perceptual and cognitive processes, modularity theory argues for their distinctness. It is argued, in particular, that the apparent plausibility of New Look theorizing derives from the failure to distinguish between the (correct) claim that perceptual processes are <jats:italic>inferential</jats:italic> and the (dubious) claim that they are <jats:italic>unencapsidated</jats:italic>, that is, that they are arbitrarily sensitive to the organism's beliefs and desires.

Arbib,1982.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We argue that a map is meaningless unless we have a process for using it. Thus, in this paper, we not only offer the world graph as a representation of relationships among situations the animal has encountered and may encounter again, but we also offer algorithms for how the information encoded in the world graph may be used by the animal in determining its behavior. Each node of the graph encodes a recognizable situation in the animal's world, but a given place may well be encoded in a number of different nodes. Nodes not only require algorithms for the recognition of the situation; they store information about drive reduction associated with the encoded situation. We note that the use of graphs as a basis for exploring some search space is well known in artificial intelligence (AI), but we stress the importance of the animal's exploration of its environment for growing the graph, as distinct from the mathematically described potential nodes frequent in AI search spaces. To explore a number of hypotheses about the way information in the world graph is used to guide the animal's movement, we recall a number of classical experiments on maze exploration by animals, and use them to argue for the nonlocal hypothesis (selection of a path does not depend only upon information about the immediate environment of the animal) and the competing nodes hypothesis (more than one drive may enter into the determination of the animal's behavior at any time). An important feature of the model is that it yields exploration and latent learning without the introduction of an exploratory drive. We also note that the performance exhibited by the model appears to be state-dependent when the animal operates under high drive levels. The drive-interaction matrix is offered as a subject for future research.<jats:p>We complement the presentation of the world graph model, its drive dynamics, and how these are constrained by experiments on maze behavior, with a brief analysis of maps in the brain. We distinguish egocentric maps–which we relate to the many visual systems–from allocentric maps. We offer a somewhat unconventional view of short-term and long-term memory. We examine cooperative computation in somatotopically organized networks, relating this to visually guided behavior in the frog, and to the interaction of colliculus and cortex in the control of eye movements. We examine, but do not advocate, the hypothesis that the hippocampus is a cognitive map. We do stress that if it is a cognitive map, it must be seen as a chart of the local neighborhood, rather than the whole atlas; and we note that the cognitive map hypothesis would lead one to expect the region to exhibit activation of place cells before the animal leaves the previous place."

Instead, these results suggest that infants can represent, extract, and generalize abstract algebraic rules."

The results obtained unify and generalize some previous work and seem to overcome criticisms to which this has been subject."

This naturally leads to the universal enumerable Solomonoff-Levin measure. Here we introduce more general, nonenumerable but cumulatively enumerable measures (CEMs) derived from Turing machines with lexicographically nondecreasing output and random input, and even more general approximable measures and distributions computable in the limit. We obtain a natural hierarchy of generalizations of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity, suggesting that the ""true"" information content of some (possibly infinite) bitstring x is the size of the shortest nonhalting program that converges to x and nothing but x on a Turing machine that can edit its previous outputs. Among other things we show that there are objects computable in the limit yet more random than Chaitin's ""number of wisdom"" Omega, that any approximable measure of x is small for any x lacking a short description, that there is no universal approximable distribution, that there is a universal CEM, and that any nonenumerable CEM of x is small for any x lacking a short enumerating program. We briefly mention consequences for universes sampled from such priors. "

The ensemble algorithms are two versions of boosting and committees of neural networks trained independently. For each of the four algorithms, we experimentally determine the test and training error curves in an optical character recognition (OCR) problem as both a function of training set size and computational cost using three architectures. We show that a single machine is best for small training set size while for large training set size some version of boosting is best. However, for a given computational cost, boosting is always best. Furthermore, we show a surprising result for the original boosting algorithm: namely, that as the training set size increases, the training error decreases until it asymptotes to the test error rate. This has potential implications in the search for better training algorithms. "

Jacobs,1995.0,"<jats:p> This article reviews statistical techniques for combining multiple probability distributions. The framework is that of a decision maker who consults several experts regarding some events. The experts express their opinions in the form of probability distributions. The decision maker must aggregate the experts' distributions into a single distribution that can be used for decision making. Two classes of aggregation methods are reviewed. When using a supra Bayesian procedure, the decision maker treats the expert opinions as data that may be combined with its own prior distribution via Bayes' rule. When using a linear opinion pool, the decision maker forms a linear combination of the expert opinions. The major feature that makes the aggregation of expert opinions difficult is the high correlation or dependence that typically occurs among these opinions. A theme of this paper is the need for training procedures that result in experts with relatively independent opinions or for aggregation methods that implicitly or explicitly model the dependence among the experts. Analyses are presented that show that m dependent experts are worth the same as k independent experts where k ≤ m. In some cases, an exact value for k can be given; in other cases, lower and upper bounds can be placed on k. "

Our networks learn faster than backpropagation for two reasons: the local representations ensure that only a few units respond to any given input, thus reducing computational overhead, and the hybrid learning rules are linear rather than nonlinear, thus leading to faster convergence. Unlike many existing methods for data analysis, our network architecture and learning rules are truly adaptive and are thus appropriate for real-time use. "

We show that if m ≥ O(W/∊ log N/∊) random examples can be loaded on a feedforward network of linear threshold functions with N nodes and W weights, so that at least a fraction 1 − ∊/2 of the examples are correctly classified, then one has confidence approaching certainty that the network will correctly classify a fraction 1 − ∊ of future test examples drawn from the same distribution. Conversely, for fully-connected feedforward nets with one hidden layer, any learning algorithm using fewer than Ω(W/∊) random training examples will, for some distributions of examples consistent with an appropriate weight choice, fail at least some fixed fraction of the time to find a weight choice that will correctly classify more than a 1 − ∊ fraction of the future test examples.

This is particularly true in areas where the problems do not lend themselves to systematic programming, such as pattern recognition in natural environments. The feasibility of learning an unknown function from examples depends on two questions: <jats:p> 1. Do the examples convey enough information to determine the function? 2. Is there a speedy way of constructing the function from the examples? <jats:p> These questions contrast the roles of information and complexity in learning. While the two roles share some ground, they are conceptually and technically different. In the common language of learning, the information question is that of generalization and the complexity question is that of scaling. The work of Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) provides the key tools for dealing with the information issue. In this review, we develop the main ideas of this framework and discuss how complexity fits in. "

A theory and model are proposed that account for two of these phenomena: the power law of practice and the problem-solving fan-effect. The power law of practice states that the speed of performance of a task will improve as a power of the number of times that the task is performed. The power law resulting from two sorts of problem-solving changes, addition of operators to the problem-space graph and alterations in the decision procedure used to decide which operator to apply at a particular state, is empirically demonstrated. The model provides an analytic account for both of these sources of the power law. The model also predicts a problem-solving fan-effect, slowdown during practice caused by an increase in the difficulty of making useful decisions between possible paths, which is also found empirically."

The objective is to find a weight matrix for the network, by repeatedly presenting to it a finite set of examples, so that the sum of the squares of the errors is minimized. Kohonen showed that with a small but fixed learning rate (or stepsize) some subsequences of the weight matrices generated by the algorithm will converge to certain matrices close to the optimal weight matrix. In this paper, we show that, by dynamically decreasing the learning rate during each training cycle, the sequence of matrices generated by the algorithm will converge to the optimal weight matrix. We also show that for any given ∊ &gt; 0 the LMS algorithm, with decreasing learning rates, will generate an ∊-optimal weight matrix (i.e., a matrix of distance at most ∊ away from the optimal matrix) after O(1/∊) training cycles. This is in contrast to Ω(1/∊log 1/∊) training cycles needed to generate an ∊-optimal weight matrix when the learning rate is kept fixed.

We investigate a classifier system, XCS, in which each classifier maintains a prediction of expected payoff, but the classifier's fitness is given by a measure of the prediction's accuracy. The system executes the genetic algorithm in niches defined by the match sets, instead of panmictically. These aspects of XCS result in its population tending to form a complete and accurate mapping X × A → P from inputs and actions to payoff predictions. Further, XCS tends to evolve classifiers that are maximally general, subject to an accuracy criterion. Besides introducing a new direction for classifier system research, these properties of XCS make it suitable for a wide range of reinforcement learning situations where generalization over states is desirable.

This article presents the mathematical framework for the development of Wave‐Nets and discusses the various aspects of their practical implementation.

The textbook account of consolidation is that for any item in memory, consolidation starts and ends just once. Recently, a heated debate has been revitalized on whether this is indeed the case, or, alternatively, whether memories become labile and must undergo some form of renewed consolidation every time they are activated. This debate focuses attention on fundamental issues concerning the nature of the memory trace, its maturation, persistence, retrievability, and modifiability."

The notion of episodic memory was first proposed some 30 years ago. At that time it was defined in terms of materials and tasks. It was subsequently refined and elaborated in terms of ideas such as self, subjective time, and autonoetic consciousness. This chapter provides a brief history of the concept of episodic memory, describes how it has changed (indeed greatly changed) since its inception, considers criticisms of it, and then discusses supporting evidence provided by (a) neuropsychological studies of patterns of memory impairment caused by brain damage, and (b) functional neuroimaging studies of patterns of brain activity of normal subjects engaged in various memory tasks. I also suggest that episodic memory is a true, even if as yet generally unappreciated, marvel of nature."

Mayes; Neil Roberts,2001.0,"<jats:p>Theories of episodic memory need to specify the encoding (representing), storage, and retrieval processes that underlie this form of memory and indicate the brain regions that mediate these processes and how they do so. Representation and re–representation (retrieval) of the spatiotemporally linked series of scenes, which constitute an episode, are probably mediated primarily by those parts of the posterior neocortex that process perceptual and semantic information. However, some role of the frontal neocortex and medial temporal lobes in representing aspects of context and high–level visual object information at encoding and retrieval cannot currently be excluded. Nevertheless, it is widely believed that the frontal neocortex is mainly involved in coordinating episodic encoding and retrieval and that the medial temporal lobes store aspects of episodic information. Establishing where storage is located is very difficult and disagreement remains about the role of the posterior neocortex in episodic memory storage. One view is that this region stores all aspects of episodic memory<jats:italic>ab initio</jats:italic>for as long as memory lasts. This is compatible with evidence that the amygdala, basal forebrain, and midbrain modulate neocortical storage. Another view is that the posterior neocortex only gradually develops the ability to store some aspects of episodic information as a function of rehearsal over time and that this information is initially stored by the medial temporal lobes. A third view is that the posterior neocortex never stores these aspects of episodic information because the medial temporal lobes store them for as long as memory lasts in an increasingly redundant fashion. The last two views both postulate that the medial temporal lobes initially store contextual markers that serve to cohere featural information stored in the neocortex. Lesion and functional neuroimaging evidence still does not clearly distinguish between these views. Whether the feeling that an episodic memory is familiar depends on retrieving an association between a retrieved episode and this feeling, or by an attribution triggered by a priming process, is unclear. Evidence about whether the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe cortices play different roles in episodic memory is conflicting. Identifying similarities and differences between episodic memory and both semantic memory and priming will require careful componential analysis of episodic memory."

Kopelman; Narinder Kapur,2001.0,"<jats:p>Retrograde amnesia in neurological disorders is a perplexing and fascinating research topic. The severity of retrograde amnesia is not well correlated with that of anterograde amnesia, and there can be disproportionate impairments of either. Within retrograde amnesia, there are various dissociations which have been claimed—for example, between the more autobiographical (episodic) and more semantic components of memory. However, the associations of different types of retrograde amnesia are also important, and clarification of these issues is confounded by the fact that retrograde amnesia seems to be particularly vulnerable to psychogenic factors. Large frontal and temporal lobe lesions have been postulated as critical in producing retrograde amnesia. Theories of retrograde amnesia have encompassed storage versus access disruption, physiological processes of ‘consolidation’, the progressive transformation of episodic memories into a more ‘semantic’ form, and multiple–trace theory. Single–case investigations, group studies and various forms of neuroimaging can all contribute to the resolution of these controversies."

While some investigators have found that retrograde amnesia in such patients is temporally graded, with relative sparing of remote memories (Squire and Alvarez, 1995), others contend that impairment is of very long duration and that remote memories are not necessarily spared (Sanders and Warrington, 1971; Nadel and Moscovitch, 1997). In this study, remote memory was assessed in 25 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy and 22 non-neurologically impaired controls using the Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman et al., 1989). Results indicate that patients have impaired personal episodic memory but intact personal semantic memory. The impairment extends even to the most remote time periods in early childhood, long before seizure onset in many patients. As well, patients awaiting temporal lobectomy for control of seizures perform as poorly as those who have already undergone resective surgery. These results support the hypothesis that temporal lobe damage or dysfunction, caused by recurrent seizures or surgical excision, results in extensive retrograde amnesia for personal episodic memories. Interestingly, patients with radiological evidence of hippocampal sclerosis were not significantly more impaired than those without obvious sclerosis. These results indicate that even minimal damage to medial temporal lobes results in significant impairment to autobiographical episodic memory. These findings are more compatible with a memory loss or retrieval deficit rather than a consolidation account of remote memory impairment."

One view is that memories are held briefly within a medial temporal store (“hippocampal complex”) before being “consolidated” or reorganised within temporal neocortex and/or networks more widely distributed within the cerebral cortex. An alternative view is that the medial temporal lobes are always involved in the storage and retrieval (reactivation) of autobiographical memories (multiple trace theory). The present study used quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 40 patients with focal pathology/volume loss in different sites, to examine the correlates of impairment on three different measures of RA. The findings supported the view that widespread neural networks are involved in the storage and retrieval of autobiographical and other remote memories. Brain volume measures in critical structures could account for 60% of variance on autobiographical memory measures (for incidents and facts) in diencephalic patients and for 60–68% of variance in patients with frontal lesions. Significant correlations with medial temporal lobe volume were found only in the diencephalic group, in whom they were thought to reflect thalamic changes, but not in patients with herpes encephalitis or hypoxia in whom the temporal lobes were particularly implicated. The latter finding fails to support one of the main predictions of multiple trace theory, as presently expounded. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."

After learning, electrolytic lesions were made in the medial septal nucleus eliminating hippocampal theta rhythm in some animals but not in others. Rats without theta rhythm were no longer able to perform the spatial task, whereas rats with undisturbed theta rhythm retrained normal performance. Although rats without theta rhythm could not find their way directly to the goal, they recognized its location when they came upon it by chance.

Front leg movement during swimming normally diminishes at about 16 days of age and is inhibited by day 22. Thyroxine also advances and cortisol delays the age at which this inhibitory mechanism becomes evident, and compresses (thyroxine) or expands (cortisol) the time interval over which it becomes functional.

One emphasizes spatially organized behaviors, especially those using cognitive maps. The other emphasizes memory, particularly working memory, a short-term memory that requires iexible stimulus-response associations and is highly susceptible to interference. The predictive value of the spatial and memory descriptions were evaluated by testing rats with damage to the hippocampal system in a series of experiments, independently manipulating the spatial and memory characteristics of a behavioral task. No dissociations were found when the spatial characteristics of the stimuli to be remembered were changed; lesions produced a similar deficit in both spatial and nonspatial test procedures, indicating that the hippocampus was similarly involved regardless of the spatial nature of the task. In contrast, a marked dissociation was found when the memory requirements were altered. Rats with lesions were able to perform accurately in tasks that could be solved exclusively on the basis of reference memory. They performed at chance levels and showed no signs of recovery even with extensive postoperative training in tasks that required working memory. In one experiment all the characteristics of the reference memory and working memory procedures were identical except the type of memory required. Consequently, the behavioral dissociation cannot be explained by differences in attention, motivation, response inhibition, or the type of stimuli to be remembered. As a result of these experiments we propose that the hippocampus is selectively involved in behaviors that require working memory, irrespective of the type of material (spatial or nonspatial) that is to be processed by that memory."

               <jats:p>A series of five experiments investigated the relationship between object memory and scene memory in normal and fornix-transected monkeys. An algorithm created formally defined background and objects on a large visual display; the disposition of some particular objects in particular places in a particular background constitutes a formally defined scene. The animals learned four types of discrimination problem: (1) object-in-place discrimination learning, in which the correct (rewarded) response was to a particular object that always occupied the same place in a particular unique background, (2) place discrimination learning, in which the correct response was to a particular place in a unique background, with no distinctive object at that place, (3) object discrimination learning in unique backgrounds, in which the correct response was to a particular object that could occupy one or the other of two possible places in a unique background, and (4) object discrimination learning in varying backgrounds, in which the correct response was to a particular object that could appear at any place in any background. The severest impairment produced by fornix transection was in object-in-place learning. Fornix transection did not impair object discrimination learning in varying backgrounds. The results from the other two types of learning task showed intermediate severity of impairment in the fornix-transected animals. The idea that fornix transection in the monkey impairs spatial memory but leaves object memory intact is thus shown to be an oversimplification. The impairments of object memory in the present experiments are analogous to the impairments of episodic memory seen in human amnesic patients."

            Allocentric spatial learning can sometimes occur in one trial. The incorporation of information into a spatial representation may, therefore, obey a one–trial correlational learning rule rather than a multi–trial error–correcting rule. It has been suggested that physiological implementation of such a rule could be mediated by
            <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>
            –methyl–D–aspartate (NMDA) receptor–dependent long–term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, as its induction obeys a correlational type of synaptic learning rule. Support for this idea came originally from the finding that intracerebral infusion of the NMDA antagonist AP5 impairs spatial learning, but studies summarized in the first part of this paper have called it into question. First, rats previously given experience of spatial learning in a watermaze can learn a new spatial reference memory task at a normal rate despite an appreciable NMDA receptor blockade. Second, the classical phenomenon of ‘blocking’ occurs in spatial learning. The latter finding implies that spatial learning can also be sensitive to an animal's expectations about reward and so depend on more than the detection of simple spatial correlations.
          
          <jats:p>In this paper a new hypothesis is proposed about the function of hippocampal LTP. This hypothesis retains the idea that LTP subserves rapid one–trial memory, but abandons the notion that it serves any specific role in the geometric aspects of spatial learning. It is suggested that LTP participates in the ‘automatic recording of attended experience’: a subsystem of episodic memory in which events are temporarily remembered in association with the contexts in which they occur. An automatic correlational form of synaptic plasticity is ideally suited to the online registration of context–event associations. In support, it is reported that the ability of rats to remember the most recent place they have visited in a familiar environment is exquisitely sensitive to AP5 in a delay–dependent manner. Moreover, new studies of the lasting persistence of NMDA–dependent LTP, known to require protein synthesis, point to intracellular mechanisms that enable transient synaptic changes to be stabilized if they occur in close temporal proximity to important events.

It is based on the use of 2‐deoxy‐D‐[<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]glucose ([<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]DG) as a tracer for the exchange of glucose between plasma and brain and its phosphorylation by hexokinase in the tissues. [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]DG is used because the label in its product, [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]deoxyglucose‐6‐phosphate, is essentially trapped in the tissue over the time course of the measurement. A model has been designed based on the assumptions of a steady state for glucose consumption, a first order equilibration of the free [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]DG pool in the tissue with the plasma level, and relative rates of phosphorylation of [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]DG and glucose determined by their relative concentrations in the precursor pools and their respective kinetic constants for the hexokinase reaction. An operational equation based on this model has been derived in terms of determinable variables. A pulse of [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]DG is administered intravenously and the arterial plasma [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]DG and glucose concentrations monitored for a preset time between 30 and 45min. At the prescribed time, the head is removed and frozen in liquid N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐chilled Freon XII, and the brain sectioned for autoradiography. Local tissue concentrations of [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]DG are determined by quantitative autoradiography. Local cerebral glucose consumption is calculated by the equation on the basis of these measured values.<jats:p>The method has been applied to normal albino rats in the conscious state and under thiopental anesthesia. The results demonstrate that the local rates of glucose consumption in the brain fall into two distinct distributions, one for gray matter and the other for white matter. In the conscious rat the values in the gray matter vary widely from structure to structure (54‐197 μmol/100 g/min) with the highest values in structures related to auditory function, e.g. medial geniculate body, superior olive, inferior colliculus, and auditory cortex. The values in white matter are more uniform (i.e. 33–40 μmo1/100 g/min) at levels approximately one‐fourth to one‐half those of gray matter. Heterogeneous rates of glucose consumption are frequently seen within specific structures, often revealing a pattern of cytoarchitecture. Thiopental anesthesia markedly depresses the rates of glucose utilization throughout the brain, particularly in gray matter, and metabolic rate throughout gray matter becomes more uniform at a lower level."

The present experiment investigated the amnesic effect of lidocaine and ECS in 25 rats trained on a working memory version of the Morris water task. Each day, the escape platform was moved to a new location; learning was evidenced by a decrease in the latency to find the platform from the first to the second trial. ""Consolidation"" of this newly encoded spatial engram was disrupted by bilateral inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus with 1 microliter of 4% lidocaine applied as soon as possible after the first trial. When trial 2 was given after recovery from the lidocaine (30 min after the injection), a normal decrease in latency indicated that the new engram was not disrupted. When trial 2 was given under the influence of lidocaine (5 min after injection), absence of latency decrease demonstrated both the success of the inactivation and the importance of hippocampus for the task. To examine the role of events immediately after learning, ECS (30 or 100 mA, 50 Hz, 1.2 sec) was applied 0 sec to 45 sec after a single escape to the new platform location. A 2-h delay between ECS and trial 2 allowed the effects of ECS to dissipate. ECS applied 45 sec or 30 sec after trial 1 caused no retrograde amnesia: escape latencies on trial 2 were the same as in control rats. However, ECS applied 0 sec or 15 sec after trial 1 induced clear retrograde amnesia: escape latencies on trial 2 were no shorter than on trial 1. It is concluded that the consolidation of a newly formed memory for spatial location can only be disrupted by ECS within 30 sec after learning."

On two different versions of the Albert <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> (1979) remote memory battery M.R.L. displayed severe retrograde amnesia (RA) extending backwards in time for about 15 years with excellent preservation of older memories. With standard recall instructions his overall performance on the Crovitz test of autobiographical memory was impaired and all of M.R.L.'s specific, temporally dated memories were given from the first half of life. When asked to reconstruct his past residential history in detail, M.R.L. provided specific and generally accurate information for residences occupied from his boyhood until 1970, but thereafter his memory became quite unreliable. On a test of knowledge of terms commonly employed the surveying profession, in which he worked for the past 20 years, M.R.L.'s performance was also impaired. The consistent pattern of RA displayed by this patient on all of the tests of remote memory indicates that both episodic and semantic memory are impaired in amnesia."

Neuropsychological and postmortem neuropathological findings are described here for three additional amnesic patients with bilateral damage limited to the hippocampal formation. Findings from these patients, taken together with the findings from patient RB and other amnesic patients, make three important points about memory. (1) Bilateral damage limited primarily to the CA1 region of the hippocampal formation is sufficient to produce moderately severe anterograde memory impairment. (2) Bilateral damage beyond the CA1 region, but still limited to the hippocampal formation, can produce more severe anterograde memory impairment. (3) Extensive, temporally graded retrograde amnesia covering 15 years or more can occur after damage limited to the hippocampal formation. Findings from studies with experimental animals are consistent with the findings from amnesic patients. The present results substantiate the idea that severity of memory impairment is dependent on locus and extent of damage within the hippocampal formation and that damage to the hippocampal formation can cause temporally graded retrograde amnesia."

Clark,2004.0,"<jats:p>▪ Abstract  The medial temporal lobe includes a system of anatomically related structures that are essential for declarative memory (conscious memory for facts and events). The system consists of the hippocampal region (CA fields, dentate gyrus, and subicular complex) and the adjacent perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. Here, we review findings from humans, monkeys, and rodents that illuminate the function of these structures. Our analysis draws on studies of human memory impairment and animal models of memory impairment, as well as neurophysiological and neuroimaging data, to show that this system (a) is principally concerned with memory, (b) operates with neocortex to establish and maintain long-term memory, and (c) ultimately, through a process of consolidation, becomes independent of long-term memory, though questions remain about the role of perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in this process and about spatial memory in rodents. Data from neurophysiology, neuroimaging, and neuroanatomy point to a division of labor within the medial temporal lobe. However, the available data do not support simple dichotomies between the functions of the hippocampus and the adjacent medial temporal cortex, such as associative versus nonassociative memory, episodic versus semantic memory, and recollection versus familiarity."

Although recent studies have demonstrated some semantic learning in amnesic patients, questions remain regarding the limits of this capacity and the extent to which it relies on those patients' residual MTL function. The present study examined whether detailed, semantic memory could be acquired by a patient with no functioning hippocampus. We used cued recall and forced‐choice recognition tasks to investigate whether the patient H.M. had acquired knowledge of people who became famous after the onset of his amnesia. Results revealed that, with first names provided as cues, he was able to recall the corresponding famous last name for 12 of 35 postoperatively famous personalities. This number nearly doubled when semantic cues were added, suggesting that his knowledge of the names was not limited to perceptual information, but was incorporated in a semantic network capable of supporting explicit recall. In forced‐choice recognition, H.M. discriminated 87% of postmorbid famous names from foils. Critically, he was able to provide uniquely identifying semantic facts for one‐third of these recognized names, describing John Glenn, for example, as “the first rocketeer” and Lee Harvey Oswald as a man who “assassinated the president.” Although H.M.'s semantic learning was clearly impaired, the results provide robust, unambiguous evidence that some new semantic learning can be supported by structures beyond the hippocampus proper. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."

The patients were given five tests of semantic knowledge for information that could only have been acquired after the onset of their amnesia in 1992 and 1987, respectively. Age‐matched and education‐matched controls (n = 8) were also tested. On tests of recall, E.P. and G.P. each scored 10% correct on a test of 20 easy factual questions (controls = 90%), 2% and 4% correct on 55 questions about news events (controls = 85%), and 0% and 4% correct on a test of 24 famous faces. On three tests of recognition memory for this same material, the patients scored at chance levels. Similarly, the patients were unable to judge whether persons who had been famous for many decades were still living or had died during the past 10 years (E.P. = 53%; G.P. = 50%; controls = 73%; chance = 50%). Lastly, neither patient E.P. nor patient G.P. could draw an accurate floor plan of his current residence, despite having lived there for 10 years and 1 year, respectively. The results demonstrate that the capacity for new semantic learning can be absent, or nearly absent, when there is virtually complete damage to the MTL bilaterally. Accordingly, the results raise the possibility that the acquisition of conscious (declarative) knowledge about the world cannot be supported by structures outside the MTL, even with extended exposure.

Crawley; Mary Pat McAndrews,2004.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recent neuroimaging studies report preferential hippocampal engagement during autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval. Although the basis of this preferential activation remains unclear, it may be related to the temporal specificity, recency, or recollective qualities of AMs, such as detail, emotionality, and personal significance. Typically, however, these variables are confounded, and thus we sought to investigate the contributions of each to hippocampal activation during AM retrieval. We conducted an event‐related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which participants retrieved temporally specific AMs and general, repeated AMs, and rated each for level of detail, emotion, or personal significance. These ratings, as well as the recency of AMs, were used in parametric modulation analyses to identify brain regions that correlated positively with ratings, independent of recency, and vice versa. Retrieval of AMs activated a number of regions, including the hippocampus. No differences in hippocampal activation were evident between specific and general AM retrieval, suggesting that temporal specificity, on its own, is not a key modulator of hippocampal activation. Activation of the left hippocampus during specific AM retrieval did vary with the level of detail, personal significance, and at a subthreshold level, emotionality, when the effect of recency was covaried out. Further, during general AM retrieval, all three recollective qualities modulated activity in the right hippocampus. Although the recency of specific AMs modulated hippocampal activation bilaterally, this effect dissipated in the left hippocampus when detail or emotionality was included as a covariate, and was no longer present in either hippocampus when personal significance was taken into account. Our results suggest that recollective qualities are important predictors of hippocampal engagement during AM retrieval independent of factors such as recency. These findings are consistent with theories of hippocampal function that emphasize its role in the recollection of multifaceted autobiographical experiences. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."

experimental (lesion, electrophysiological, and gene-activation) 
studies with animals, the anatomy underlying anterograde amnesia 
has been reformulated. The distinction between temporal lobe and 
diencephalic amnesia is of limited value in that a common feature 
of anterograde amnesia is damage to part of an “extended 
hippocampal system” comprising the hippocampus, the fornix, 
the mamillary bodies, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. This view, 
which can be traced back to Delay and Brion (1969), differs from 
other recent models in placing critical importance on the efferents 
from the hippocampus via the fornix to the diencephalon. These 
are necessary for the encoding and, hence, the effective subsequent 
recall of episodic memory. An additional feature of this 
hippocampal–anterior thalamic axis is the presence 
of projections back from the diencephalon to the temporal 
cortex and hippocampus that also support episodic memory. 
In contrast, this hippocampal system is not required for tests 
of item recognition that primarily tax familiarity judgements. 
Familiarity judgements reflect an independent process that depends 
on a distinct system involving the perirhinal cortex of the temporal 
lobe and the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. In the large 
majority of amnesic cases both the hippocampal–anterior 
thalamic and the perirhinal–medial dorsal thalamic systems 
are compromised, leading to severe deficits in both recall and 
recognition."

The extension of this model, to include the retrieval from human long-term memory of spatial scenes and the spatial context of events is discussed. The model explores the link between spatial and mnemonic functions by supposing that retrieval of spatial information from long-term storage requires the imposition of a particular viewpoint. It is consistent with data relating to representational hemispatial neglect and the involvement of the mammillary bodies, anterior thalamus, and hippocampal formation in supporting both episodic recall and the representation of head direction. Some recent behavioural, neuropsychological, and functional neuroimaging experiments are reviewed, in which virtual reality is used to allow controlled study of navigation and memory for events set within a rich large-scale spatial context. These studies provide convergent evidence that the human hippocampus is involved in both tasks, with some lateralization of function (navigation on the right and episodic memory on the left). A further experiment indicates hippocampal involvement in retrieval of spatial information from a shifted viewpoint. I speculate that the hippocampal role in episodic recollection relates to its ability to represent a viewpoint moving within a spatial framework. "

King; John O'Keefe,2001.0,"<jats:p>The computational role of the hippocampus in memory has been characterized as: (i) an index to disparate neocortical storage sites; (ii) a time–limited store supporting neocortical long–term memory; and (iii) a content–addressable associative memory. These ideas are reviewed and related to several general aspects of episodic memory, including the differences between episodic, recognition and semantic memory, and whether hippocampal lesions differentially affect recent or remote memories. Some outstanding questions remain, such as: what characterizes episodic retrieval as opposed to other forms of read–out from memory; what triggers the storage of an event memory; and what are the neural mechanisms involved? To address these questions a neural–level model of the medial temporal and parietal roles in retrieval of the spatial context of an event is presented. This model combines the idea that retrieval of the rich context of real–life events is a central characteristic of episodic memory, and the idea that medial temporal allocentric representations are used in long–term storage while parietal egocentric representations are used to imagine, manipulate and re–experience the products of retrieval. The model is consistent with the known neural representation of spatial information in the brain, and provides an explanation for the involvement of Papez's circuit in both the representation of heading direction and in the recollection of episodic information. Two experiments relating to the model are briefly described. A functional neuroimaging study of memory for the spatial context of life–like events in virtual reality provides support for the model's functional localization. A neuropsychological experiment suggests that the hippocampus does store an allocentric representation of spatial locations."

               <jats:p>Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have been extensively used to explore the functional neuroanatomy of cognitive functions. Here we review 275 PET and fMRI studies of attention (sustained, selective, Stroop, orientation, divided), perception (object, face, space/motion, smell), imagery (object, space/ motion), language (written/spoken word recognition, spoken/ no spoken response), working memory (verbal/numeric, object, spatial, problem solving), semantic memory retrieval (categorization, generation), episodic memory encoding (verbal, object, spatial), episodic memory retrieval (verbal, nonverbal, success, effort, mode, context), priming (perceptual, conceptual), and procedural memory (conditioning, motor, and nonmotor skill learning). To identify consistent activation patterns associated with these cognitive operations, data from 412 contrasts were summarized at the level of cortical Brodmann's areas, insula, thalamus, medial-temporal lobe (including hippocampus), basal ganglia, and cerebellum. For perception and imagery, activation patterns included primary and secondary regions in the dorsal and ventral pathways. For attention and working memory, activations were usually found in prefrontal and parietal regions. For language and semantic memory retrieval, typical regions included left prefrontal and temporal regions. For episodic memory encoding, consistently activated regions included left prefrontal and medial-temporal regions. For episodic memory retrieval, activation patterns included prefrontal, medial-temporal, and posterior midline regions. For priming, deactivations in prefrontal (conceptual) or extrastriate (perceptual) regions were consistently seen. For procedural memory, activations were found in motor as well as in non-motor brain areas. Analysis of regional activations across cognitive domains suggested that several brain regions, including the cerebellum, are engaged by a variety of cognitive challenges. These observations are discussed in relation to functional specialization as well as functional integration."

               <jats:p>Functional neuroimaging studies of episodic memory retrieval generally measure brain activity while participants remember items encountered in the laboratory (“controlled laboratory condition”) or events from their own life (“open autobiographical condition”). Differences in activation between these conditions may reflect differences in retrieval processes, memory remoteness, emotional content, retrieval success, self-referential processing, visual/spatial memory, and recollection. To clarify the nature of these differences, a functional MRI study was conducted using a novel “photo paradigm,” which allows greater control over the autobiographical condition, including a measure of retrieval accuracy. Undergraduate students took photos in specified campus locations (“controlled autobiographical condition”), viewed in the laboratory similar photos taken by other participants (controlled laboratory condition), and were then scanned while recognizing the two kinds of photos. Both conditions activated a common episodic memory network that included medial temporal and prefrontal regions. Compared with the controlled laboratory condition, the controlled autobiographical condition elicited greater activity in regions associated with self-referential processing (medial prefrontal cortex), visual/ spatial memory (visual and parahippocampal regions), and recollection (hippocampus). The photo paradigm provides a way of investigating the functional neuroanatomy of real-life episodic memory under rigorous experimental control."

In general terms, the overall pattern across studies is of medial and left–lateralized activations associated with retrieval of autobiographical event memories. It seems that the medial frontal cortex and left hippocampus in particular are responsive to such memories. However, there are also inconsistencies across studies, for example in the activation of the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It is likely that methodological differences between studies contribute to the disparate findings. Quantifying and assessing autobiographical event memories presents a challenge in many domains, including neuroimaging. Methodological factors that may be pertinent to the interpretation of the neuroimaging data and the design of future experiments are discussed. Consideration is also given to aspects of memory that functional neuroimaging might be uniquely disposed to examine. These include assessing the functionality of damaged tissue in patients and the estimation of inter–regional communication (effective connectivity) between relevant brain regions."

There is no doubt that the prefrontal cortical areas of the human brain have undergone considerable development, but it is equally clear that the basic architectonic organization is the same in the two species. Thus, a comparative approach to the study of the functional organization of the primate prefrontal cortex is more likely to reveal the essential aspects of the various complex control processes that are the domain of frontal function. The lateral frontal cortex appears to be functionally organized along both a rostral–caudal axis and a dorsal–ventral axis. The most caudal frontal region, the motor region on the precentral gyrus, is involved in fine motor control and direct sensorimotor mappings, whereas the caudal lateral prefrontal region is involved in higher order control processes that regulate the selection among multiple competing responses and stimuli based on conditional operations. Further rostrally, the mid-lateral prefrontal region plays an even more abstract role in cognitive control. The mid-lateral prefrontal region is itself organized along a dorsal–ventral axis of organization, with the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex being involved in the monitoring of information in working memory and the mid-ventrolateral prefrontal region being involved in active judgments on information held in posterior cortical association regions that are necessary for active retrieval and encoding of information."

Twelve healthy volunteers indicated whether their old-new judgments were made with high or low confidence. Hemodynamic responses associated with each judgment were modeled with an “early” and a “late” response function. As predicted by the monitoring hypothesis generated from a previous recognition study [Henson, R. N. A., Rugg, M. D., Shallice, T., Josephs, O., &amp; Dolan, R. J. (1999a). Recollection and familiarity in recognition memory: An event-related fMRI study. Journal of Neuroscience, 19, 3962-3972], a right dorsolateral prefrontal region showed a greater response to correct low-versus correct high-confidence judgements. Several regions, including the precuneus, posterior cingulate, and left lateral parietal cortex, showed greater responses to correct old than correct new judgements. The anterior left and right prefrontal regions also showed an old-new difference, but for these regions the difference emerged relatively later in time. These results further support the proposal that different subregions of the prefrontal cortex subserve different functions during episodic retrieval. These functions are discussed in relation to a monitoring process, which operates when familiarity levels are close to response criterion and is associated with nonconfident judgements, and a recollective process, which is associated with the confident recognition of old words."

Twelve healthy young adults watched a videotape segment in which two speakers alternatively presented lists of associated words, and then the subjects performed a recognition test including words presented in the study lists (True items), new words closely related to studied words (False items), and new unrelated words (New items). The main finding was a dissociation between two MTL regions: whereas the hippocampus was similarly activated for True and False items, suggesting the recovery of semantic information, the parahippocampal gyrus was more activated for True than for False items, suggesting the recovery of perceptual information. The study also yielded a dissociation between two prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions: whereas bilateral dorsolateral PFC was more activated for True and False items than for New items, possibly reflecting monitoring of retrieved information, left ventrolateral PFC was more activated for New than for True and False items, possibly reflecting semantic processing. Precuneus and lateral parietal regions were more activated for True and False than for New items. Orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellar regions were more activated for False than for True items. In conclusion, the results suggest that activity in anterior MTL regions does not distinguish True from False, whereas activity in posterior MTL regions does."

            Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is among those brain regions having
 the highest baseline metabolic activity at rest and one that exhibits
 decreases from this baseline across a wide variety of goal-directed
 behaviors in functional imaging studies. This high metabolic rate and
 this behavior suggest the existence of an organized mode of default
 brain function, elements of which may be either attenuated or enhanced.
 Extant data suggest that these MPFC regions may contribute to the
 neural instantiation of aspects of the multifaceted “self.” We
 explore this important concept by targeting and manipulating elements
 of MPFC default state activity. In this functional magnetic resonance
 imaging (fMRI) study, subjects made two judgments, one
 self-referential, the other not, in response to affectively normed
 pictures: pleasant vs. unpleasant (an internally cued condition, ICC)
 and indoors vs. outdoors (an externally cued condition, ECC). The ICC
 was preferentially associated with activity increases along the dorsal
 MPFC. These increases were accompanied by decreases in both active task
 conditions in ventral MPFC. These results support the view that dorsal
 and ventral MPFC are differentially influenced by
 attentiondemanding tasks and explicitly self-referential tasks.
 The presence of self-referential
            <jats:italic>mental activity</jats:italic>
            appears
 to be associated with increases from the baseline in dorsal MPFC.
 Reductions in ventral MPFC occurred consistent with the fact that
 attention-demanding tasks attenuate emotional processing. We posit that
 both self-referential mental activity and emotional processing
 represent elements of the default state as represented by activity in
 MPFC. We suggest that a useful way to explore the neurobiology of the
 self is to explore the nature of default state activity.

               <jats:p>Researchers have long debated whether knowledge about the self is unique in terms of its functional anatomic representation within the human brain. In the context of memory function, knowledge about the self is typically remembered better than other types of semantic information. But why does this memorial effect emerge? Extending previous research on this topic (see Craik et al., 1999), the present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate potential neural substrates of self-referential processing. Participants were imaged while making judgments about trait adjectives under three experimental conditions (self-relevance, other-relevance, or case judgment). Relevance judgments, when compared to case judgments, were accompanied by activation of the left inferior frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate. A separate region of the medial prefrontal cortex was selectively engaged during self-referential processing. Collectively, these findings suggest that self-referential processing is functionally dissociable from other forms of semantic processing within the human brain."

However, the systems have not been considered as interacting components of episodic memory, as is proposed here.

A review of REM deprivation (REMD) studies in animals shows these reports to be about equally divided in showing that REMD does, or does not, disrupt learning/memory. The studies supporting a relationship between REM sleep and memory have been strongly criticized for the confounding effects of very stressful REM deprivation techniques. The three major classes of antidepressant drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), profoundly suppress REM sleep. The MAOIs virtually abolish REM sleep, and the TCAs and SSRIs have been shown to produce immediate (40–85%) and sustained (30–50%) reductions in REM sleep. Despite marked suppression of REM sleep, these classes of antidepressants on the whole do not disrupt learning/memory. There have been a few reports of patients who have survived bilateral lesions of the pons with few lingering complications. Although these lesions essentially abolished REM sleep, the patients reportedly led normal lives. Recent functional imaging studies in humans have revealed patterns of brain activity in REM sleep that are consistent with dream processes but not with memory consolidation. We propose that the primary function of REM sleep is to provide periodic endogenous stimulation to the brain which serves to maintain requisite levels of central nervous system (CNS) activity throughout sleep. REM is the mechanism used by the brain to promote recovery from sleep. We believe that the cumulative evidence indicates that REM sleep serves no role in the processing or consolidation of memory."

               <jats:p>Performance on a visual discrimination task shows longterm improvement after a single training session. When tested within 24 hr of training, improvement, was not observed unless subjects obtained at least 6 hr of postraining sleep prior to retesting, in which case improvement was proportional to the amount of sleep in excess of 6 hr. For subjects averaging 8 hr of sleep, overnight improvement was proportional to the amount of slow wave sleep (SWS) in the first quarter of the night, as well as the amount of rapid eye movement sleep (REM) in the last quarter. REM during the intervening 4 hr did not appear to contribute to improvement. A two-step process, modeling throughput as the product of the amount of early SWS and late REM, accounts for 80 percent of intersubject variance. These results suggest that, in the case of this visual discrimination task, both SWS and REM are required to consolidate experience-dependent neuronal changes into a form that supports improved task performance."

Humans with pharmacological and brain lesion–induced suppression of REM sleep do not show memory deficits, and other human sleep-learning studies have not produced consistent results. The time spent in REM sleep is not correlated with learning ability across humans, nor is there a positive relation between REM sleep time or intensity and encephalization across species.

Sleep has been identified as a state that optimizes the consolidation of newly acquired information in memory. Consolidation is an active process that is presumed to rely on the covert reactivation and reorganization of newly encoded representations. Hippocampus-dependent memories benefit primarily from slow-wave sleep (SWS), whereas memories not depending on the hippocampus show greater gains over periods containing high amounts of rapid eye movement sleep. One way sleep does this is by establishing different patterns of neurotransmitters and neurohormone secretion between sleep stages. Another central role for consolidating memories is played by the slow oscillation, that is, the oscillating field potential change dominating SWS. The emergence of slow oscillations in neocortical networks depends on the prior use of these networks for encoding of information. Via efferent pathways, they synchronize the occurrence of sharp wave ripples accompanying memory reactivations in the hippocampus with thalamocortical spindle activity. Thus, hippocampal memories are fed back into neocortical networks at a time when these networks are depolarized and, because of concurrent spindle activity, can most sensitively react to these inputs with plastic changes underlying the formation of long-term memory representations.

Walker,2005.0,"<jats:p>Research in the neurosciences continues to provide evidence that sleep plays a role in the processes of learning and memory. There is less of a consensus, however, regarding the precise stages of memory development during which sleep is considered a requirement, simply favorable, or not important. This article begins with an overview of recent studies regarding sleep and learning, predominantly in the procedural memory domain, and is measured against our current understanding of the mechanisms that govern memory formation. Based on these considerations, I offer a new neurocognitive framework of procedural learning, consisting first of acquisition, followed by two specific stages of consolidation, one involving a process of <jats:italic>stabilization,</jats:italic> the other involving <jats:italic>enhancement,</jats:italic> whereby delayed learning occurs. Psychophysiological evidence indicates that initial acquisition does not rely fundamentally on sleep. This also appears to be true for the stabilization phase of consolidation, with durable representations, resistant to interference, clearly developing in a successful manner during time awake (or just time, per se). In contrast, the consolidation stage, resulting in additional/enhanced learning in the absence of further rehearsal, does appear to rely on the process of sleep, with evidence for specific sleep-stage dependencies across the procedural domain. Evaluations at a molecular, cellular, and systems level currently offer several sleep specific candidates that could play a role in sleep-dependent learning. These include the upregulation of select plasticity-associated genes, increased protein synthesis, changes in neurotransmitter concentration, and specific electrical events in neuronal networks that modulate synaptic potentiation."

between sleep and memory. Here we summarize a series of our own studies in
humans supporting a beneficial influence of slow-wave sleep (SWS) on
declarative memory formation, and try to identify some mechanisms that might
underlie this influence. Specifically, these experiments show that declarative
memory benefits mainly from sleep periods dominated by SWS, whereas there is
no consistent benefit of this memory from periods rich in rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep. A main mechanism of declarative memory formation is believed to
be the reactivation of newly acquired memory representations in hippocampal
networks that stimulates a transfer and integration of these representations
into neocortical neuronal networks. Consistent with this model, spindle
activity and slow oscillation-related EEG coherence increase during early
sleep after intense declarative learning in humans, signs that together point
toward a neocortical reprocessing of the learned material. In addition, sleep
seems to provide an optimal milieu for declarative memory reprocessing and
consolidation by reducing cholinergic activation and the cortisol feedback to
the hippocampus during SWS."

Independent of whether placed during daytime or nighttime, sleep after practice enhanced speed of sequence performance on average by 33.5% and reduced error rate by 30.1% as compared with corresponding intervals of wakefulness. The effect of sleep after learning proved to be stable when retesting was postponed for another night, to exclude effects of sleep loss and to assure that all subjects had sufficient sleep before retrieval testing. Also, the consolidating effect of sleep was specific for the motor sequence learned. It did not generalize to a similar sequence containing identical movement segments in a different order. Retention periods of wakefulness improved performance only moderately and only if placed during daytime. The observations demonstrate a critical role of sleep for storing and optimizing motor skills."

We show that declarative memory is enhanced when sleep follows within a few hours of learning, independent of time of day, and with equal amounts of interference during retention intervals. Sleep deprivation has a detrimental effect on memory, which was significant after a night of recovery sleep. Thus, fatigue accumulating during wake intervals could be ruled out as a confound."

               <jats:p>Recall of paired-associate lists (declarative memory) and mirror-tracing skills (procedural memory) was assessed after retention intervals defined over early and late nocturnal sleep. In addition, effects of sleep on recall were compared with those of early and late retention intervals filled with wakefulness. Twenty healthy men served as subjects. Saliva cortisol concentrations were determined before and after the retention intervals to determine pituitary-adrenal secretory activity. Sleep was determined somnopolygraphically. Sleep generally enhanced recall when compared with the effects of corresponding retention intervals of wakefulness. The benefit from sleep on recall depended on the phase of sleep and on the type of memory: Recall of paired-associate lists improved more during early sleep, and recall of mirror-tracing skills improved more during late sleep. The effects may reflect different influences of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep since time in SWS was 5 times longer during the early than late sleep retention interval, and time in REM sleep was twice as long during late than early sleep (p &amp;lt; 0.005). Changes in cortisol concentrations, which independently of sleep and wakefulness were lower during early retention intervals than late ones, cannot account for the effects of sleep on memory. The experiments for the first time dissociate specific effects of early and late sleep on two principal types of memory, declarative and procedural, in humans."

In this study, we examined how sleep deprivation hinders this consolidation process. Using functional MRI, we mapped regional cerebral activity during place-finding navigation in a virtual town, immediately after learning and 3 days later, in subjects either allowed regular sleep (RS) or totally sleep-deprived (TSD) on the first posttraining night. At immediate and delayed retrieval, place-finding navigation elicited increased brain activity in an extended hippocampo-neocortical network in both RS and TSD subjects. Behavioral performance was equivalent between groups. However, striatal navigation-related activity increased more at delayed retrieval in RS than in TSD subjects. Furthermore, correlations between striatal response and behavioral performance, as well as functional connectivity between the striatum and the hippocampus, were modulated by posttraining sleep. These data suggest that brain activity is restructured during sleep in such a way that navigation in the virtual environment, initially related to a hippocampus-dependent spatial strategy, becomes progressively contingent in part on a response-based strategy mediated by the striatum. Both neural strategies eventually relate to equivalent performance levels, indicating that covert reorganization of brain patterns underlying navigation after sleep is not necessarily accompanied by overt changes in behavior."

To experimentally induce widespread extracellular negative DC potentials, we applied anodal tDCS (0.26 mA/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) repeatedly (over 30 min) bilaterally at frontocortical electrode sites during a retention period rich in SWS. Retention of declarative memories (word pairs) and also nondeclarative memories (mirror tracing skills) learned previously was tested after this period and compared with retention performance after placebo stimulation as well as after retention intervals of wakefulness. Compared with placebo stimulation, anodal tDCS during SWS-rich sleep distinctly increased the retention of word pairs (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt; 0.005). When applied during the wake retention interval, tDCS did not affect declarative memory. Procedural memory was also not affected by tDCS.

Acutely, anodal tDCS increased slow oscillatory activity &lt;3 Hz. We conclude that effects of tDCS involve enhanced generation of slow oscillatory EEG activity considered to facilitate processes of neuronal plasticity. Shifts in extracellular ionic concentration in frontocortical tissue (expressed as negative DC potentials during SWS) may facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memories."

We suggest that neocortico‐hippocampal transfer of information and the modification process in neocortical circuitries by the hippocampal output take place in a temporally discontinuous manner associated with the wake‐sleep cycle. Loading the hippocampus with neocortical information may happen fast during the aroused state of the hippocampus associated with theta/gamma oscillations. On the other hand, transfer of the stored representations to neocortical areas is carried by discrete quanta of co‐operative neuronal bursts (called sharp wave bursts) initiated in the hippocampus during slow wave sleep. The spatio‐temporal participation of principal cells in sharp waves is determined by experience‐induced changes in the CA3 recurrent collateral matrix. The co‐operative, converging pre‐synaptic activity can induce localized fast spikes and associated calcium influx in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, a necessary condition for the induction of synaptic plasticity. In addition, the subcortical effects of hippocampal sharp wave bursts may be critical in the release of various hormones which, in turn, may affect synaptic plasticity. These observations suggest that sleep patterns in the limbic system are essential for the preservation of experience‐induced synaptic modifications."

Compared with a nonlearning control condition, learning performance was accompanied with a strong increase in coherence in several EEG frequency bands. During subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep, coherence only marginally increased in a global analysis of EEG recordings. However, a striking and robust increase in learning-dependent coherence was found when analyses were performed time-locked to the occurrence of slow oscillations (&lt;1 Hz). Specifically, the surface-positive half-waves of the slow oscillation resulting from widespread cortical depolarization were associated with distinctly enhanced coherence after learning in the slow-oscillatory, delta, slow-spindle, and gamma bands.

Sara; Jan Born,2006.0,"<jats:p> Slow oscillations originating in the prefrontal neocortex during slow-wave sleep (SWS) group neuronal network activity and thereby presumably support the consolidation of memories. Here, we investigated whether the grouping influence of slow oscillations extends to hippocampal sharp wave-ripple (SPW) activity thought to underlie memory replay processes during SWS. The prefrontal surface EEG and multiunit activity (MUA), along with hippocampal local field potentials (LFP) from CA1, were recorded in rats during sleep. Average spindle and ripple activity and event correlation histograms of SPWs were calculated, time-locked to half-waves of slow oscillations. Results confirm decreased prefrontal MUA and spindle activity during EEG slow oscillation negativity and increases in this activity during subsequent positivity. A remarkably close temporal link was revealed between slow oscillations and hippocampal activity, with ripple activity and SPWs being also distinctly decreased during negative half-waves and increased during slow oscillation positivity. Fine-grained analyses of temporal dynamics revealed for the slow oscillation a phase delay of approximately 90 ms with reference to up and down states of prefrontal MUA, and of only approximately 60 ms with reference to changes in SPWs, indicating that up and down states in prefrontal MUA precede corresponding changes in hippocampal SPWs by approximately 30 ms. Results support the notion that the depolarizing surface-positive phase of the slow oscillation and the associated up state of prefrontal excitation promotes hippocampal SPWs via efferent pathways. The preceding disfacilitation of hippocampal events temporally coupled to the negative slow oscillation half-wave appears to serve a synchronizing role in this neocorticohippocampal interplay. "

Eight subjects slept in the laboratory for five consecutive nights. During a 6‐h period prior to night 3, either the left or the right hand was vibrated intermittently (20 min on‐8 min off), while prior to night 5 the same treatment was applied to the contralateral hand. The sleep EEG was recorded from frontal, central, parietal and occipital derivations and subjected to spectral analysis. The interhemispheric asymmetry index (IAI) was calculated for spectral power in nonREM sleep in the frequency range 0.25‐25.0 Hz for 0.5‐Hz or 1‐Hz bins. In the first hour of sleep following right‐hand stimulation, the IAI of the central derivation was increased relative to baseline, which corresponds to a shift of power towards the left hemisphere. This effect was most prominent in the delta range, was limited to the first hour of sleep and was restricted to the central derivation situated over the somatosensory cortex. No significant changes were observed following left‐hand stimulation. Although the effect was small, it is consistent with the hypothesis that the activation of specific neuronal populations during wakefulness may have repercussions on their electrical activity pattern during subsequent sleep."

Here we review the evidence that the medial temporal lobe memory system is involved in a process of consolidation: memories are initially dependent on this system but gradually become established in other areas of the brain.

Within 1 hour, serotonin led to a 50% decrease in the density of gold-labeled complexes at the surface membrane of the sensory neuron. This down-regulation was achieved by a heterologous, protein synthesis-dependent activation of the endosomal pathway, which leads to internalization and apparent degradation of apCAM. The internalization is particularly prominent at sites where the processes of the sensory neurons contact one another and may act there to destabilize process-to-process contacts that normally inhibit growth. In turn, the endocytic activation may lead to a redistribution of membrane components to sites where new synapses form.

Alger,1984.0,"<jats:p> An orthodromically evoked late hyperpolarizing potential (LHP) was studied using intracellular recording techniques in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in vitro. Several tests indicated that the LHP is not blocked by GABA antagonists, but rather comprises the initial portion of the stimulation-induced burst afterhyperpolarization (AHPs) produced in the presence of these antagonists. Bath application of magnesium (Mg) or 8-bromo adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), or intracellular injection of ethyleneglycol-bis (beta-amino-ethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) blocked the late portion of the AHPs, at times when the early portion was only slightly or not at all affected. The late part of the AHPs was also associated with the voltage-dependent components of the burst, whereas the early part was not. Both the early part of the burst AHPs and the LHP in standard saline have similar time courses and dependence on membrane potential. The LHP was nullified by hyperpolarization of the membrane in extracellular potassium concentrations [( K]o) of 5.4 mM and below and could be reversed in [K]o above 5.4 mM. The apparent reversal potential for the LHP followed shifts in [K]o as predicted by the Nernst equation and is, therefore, probably a K-dependent potential. No specific antagonist of the LHP from among several K conductance blockers was found, however. An alternative hypothesis, that the LHP might be an electrogenic pump effect was not supported. Ouabain depressed the LHP; however this effect was probably nonspecific and due, in part, to a ouabain-induced increase in [K]o. Decreasing temperature in the range 37-22 degrees C prolonged but did not block the LHP. The LHP was enhanced by increases in extracellular calcium concentration and depressed by high [Mg]o or cadmium. It was associated with a small (14%) decrease in total resting input resistance. In cells depolarized to approximately 0 mV, regenerative voltage-dependent potentials were blocked; however, an LHP still occurred. The LHP was not found to be dependent on the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). With weak stimuli LHP and EPSP amplitudes were uncorrelated and the EPSP was more resistant than the LHP to block by high [Mg]o. The LHP continued to occur when the EPSP was reversed in depolarized cells. The LHP may be mediated by interneuronal circuitry within a slice. In GABA antagonists the LHP occasionally occurred spontaneously at regular intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

The afterhyperpolarization produced in the presence of γ-aminobutyric acid antagonists is associated with a conductance increase and is inhibitory. It can occur in an all-or-none fashion after a burst, is independent of chloride, and is depressed by barium. The afterhyperpolarization has a reversal potential of -86 millivolts, and the reversal potential is strongly dependent on the extracellular concentration of potassium. The afterhyperpolarization appears to be an intrinsic, inhibitory potassium potential mediated by calcium. This finding has implications for understanding the cellular mechanisms of epilepsy."

Hablitz,1984.0,"<jats:p> Picrotoxin-(PTX) induced epileptiform activity was studied in guinea pig hippocampal slices maintained in vitro, using intra- and extracellular recording techniques. The observed pattern of spontaneous and evoked epileptiform activity was quite complex. Spontaneous epileptiform events originated in the CA3 region and subsequently spread or propagated to CA1. Activation of CA1 could then reactivate CA3. This reverberation of activity was seen also following stimulation of the mossy fiber afferents from the dentate gyrus to CA3. Stimulation of fibers in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region could trigger, at short latency, epileptiform activity that either was localized in CA1 or also occurred in CA3, with a late secondary discharge in CA1. This is attributed to a backfiring of the Schaffer collaterals and illustrates the ability of a variety of CA3 inputs to trigger epileptiform activity. Bath-applied PTX, at concentrations of 50-200 microM, had no apparent effect on the resting membrane potential or input resistance of the CA3 cells tested. Depolarizing current pulses elicited characteristic endogenous-burst responses that were not altered by PTX. Synaptic activity evoked by mossy fiber stimulation was altered markedly by PTX. The pattern of observed changes indicated that PTX reduced inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes, resulting in the appearance of repetitive (presumably recurrent) excitatory inputs. Paroxysmal depolarizing shifts ( PDSs ) were generated by the coalescence of these excitatory inputs. Two types of spontaneous bursting were observed after PTX application. The first type was nonepileptiform , all or none in nature, and its frequency was voltage dependent. The second type of spontaneous burst was the PDS. It was epileptiform in character because it was associated with the synchronous discharge of many neurons. It was graded in nature, and its frequency was voltage independent. The graded nature of the PDS was demonstrated by varying the duration and intensity of the orthodromic stimulation. Trains of stimulation could produce PDSs that lasted 500-800 ms. A refractory period was observed following a PDS. By varying the strength of the orthodromic stimulation, it was possible to demonstrate that for the intervals tested this was a relative, not absolute, refractory period. Intracellular recordings in CA3 neurons indicated that each spontaneous PDS was followed by an afterhyperpolarization (AHP). "

L.t.p. of the population spike is often disproportionately greater than l.t.p. of the population excitatory post‐synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.). We have investigated the basis of this effect in rats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. A series of graded stimuli were given before and after tetanization of the perforant path. From data obtained in this way, we plotted stimulus‐response curves, and the relation (E‐S curve) between the slope of the population e.p.s.p. (E) and the amplitude of the population spike (S). Curves relating spike onset latency to the slope of the e.p.s.p. were also constructed. Tetanization of the combined medial and lateral components of the perforant path led to long‐term changes in the relation between the e.p.s.p. and the population spike. For a given e.p.s.p., the corresponding population spike was of greater amplitude and earlier onset. This E‐S potentiation was marked by a shift to the left of the E‐S amplitude curve and a downward displacement of the E‐S latency curve. Tetanization of the lateral component of the perforant path had two long‐term effects on responses evoked by test stimuli to the untetanized medial component: (1) long‐term depression of the medial e.p.s.p. and (2) long‐term E‐S potentiation. The net result of these two heterosynaptically induced effects was to leave unaltered information transfer across medial perforant path‐granule cell synapses; for a given test volley the e.p.s.p. was smaller, but because of E‐S potentiation the population spike remained relatively unaffected. Short‐term potentiation, which has a time course of only a few minutes and is presumed to be mediated by presynaptic mechanisms, was not accompanied by E‐S potentiation or by corresponding changes in spike latency. Possible mechanisms of long‐term heterosynaptic depression of the e.p.s.p. and of homo‐ and heterosynaptic E‐S potentiation, are discussed. We conclude that although these effects probably reflect a generalized post‐synaptic change, this change is unlikely to be a prolonged reduction in the membrane potential of granule cells."

Hippocampi were dissected from the brains of 28‐day‐old rats, fixed and impregnated by immersion, and sectioned perpendicular to the long axis. Based on the resident cell types, aspects of the neuropil, and published data related to afferent termination, the area under study was divided into four zones. At least 21 cell types were observed throughout these zones, several of which had not previously been described. Many cells in this area exhibited an impressive number and variety of dendritic and axonal appendages, including spines on the proximal portion of some axons. The close apposition of fibers to these axonal spines suggested the possibility of axo‐axonal interactions. The influence of dentate granule cells, through their mossy fibers, on the synaptic economy of the “hilar region” was found to be more extensive than previously reported. Mossy fibers appeared to terminate on the dendrites of several types of non‐pyramidal cells, which bear no thorny excrescences, by means of thin filiform extensions which emanate from the mossy fiber expansions and by means of thin mossy fiber collaterals which are devoid of typical expansions. Consideration is given to a long‐standing debate as to whether the deep “hilar region” (CA4 of Lorente de Nó, '34, hilus of the <jats:italic>fascia dentata</jats:italic> of Blackstad, '56) is related more to the hippocampus or to the <jats:italic>fascia dentata</jats:italic> and it is concluded that the deep hilar region is an area of mergence of the <jats:italic>polymorphic zones</jats:italic> of these two <jats:italic>cortical</jats:italic> structures.

Single unit and multiple unit extracellular recordings yielded a consistent set of characteristic discharge properties. (1) Tonic discharge co-varied with stages of the S-WC, being highest during waking, lower during slow wave sleep, and virtually absent during paradoxical sleep. (2) Discharge anticipated S-WC stages as well as phasic cortical activity, such as spindles, during slow wave sleep. (3) Discharge decreased within active waking during grooming and sweet water consumption. (4) Bursts of impulses accompanied spontaneous or sensory-evoked interruptions of sleep, grooming, consumption, or other such ongoing behavior. (5) These characteristic discharge properties were topographically homogeneous for recordings throughout the NE-LC. (6) Phasic robust activity was synchronized markedly among neurons in multiple unit populations. (7) Field potentials occurred spontaneously in the NE-LC and were synchronized with bursts of unit activity from the same electrodes. (8) Field potentials became dissociated from unit activity during paradoxical sleep, exhibiting their highest rates in the virtual absence of impulses. These results are generally consistent with previous proposals that the NE-LC system is involved in regulating cortical and behavioral arousal. On the basis of the present data and those described in the following report (Aston-Jones, G., and F. E. Bloom (1981) J.

Brief, high‐frequency stimulation of the perforant path results in a long‐term potentiation (l.t.p.) of the field response evoked in the dentate gyrus by single shocks to the perforant path. We have compared the magnitude and duration of l.t.p. in normal, anaesthetized rats with animals depleted of noradrenaline (NA), 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT), or both. 2. All animals were exposed to an identical sequence of eight high‐frequency trains of increasing intensity given over a period of 140 min to the perforant path of one hemisphere. The potential evoked by test shocks to the perforant path was monitored in both hemispheres throughout this period and for a further 96 min after the last train. 3. Plots of the mean potentiation of the population e.p.s.p. as a function of time were computed for all animals in each group. L.t.p. in the NA‐depleted group was about 50% of that in the non‐depleted control group throughout the course of the experiment. L.t.p. in the 5‐HT‐depleted group was more severely affected; mean potentiation did not exceed 30% of that in the control group at any time. 4. The duration of l.t.p. was unaffected by NA depletion and reduced by 5‐HT depletion. 5. The threshold for the intensity of high‐frequency current pulses necessary to elicit l.t.p. was unaffected by NA depletion and raised by 5‐HT depletion. 6. Short‐term potentiation of the population e.p.s.p. was unaffected by either NA depletion or 5‐HT depletion. 7. The effect of monoamine depletion on granule cell excitability was investigated. 5‐HT depletion, but not NA depletion, induced an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population, in the sense that a population e.p.s.p. of a given size was associated with a larger population spike. 8. Long‐term potentiation of granule cell excitability was not affected by NA depletion, but was reduced by 5‐HT depletion. 9. These results show that monoamines can modulate long‐term changes in synaptic function in the dentate gyrus, and suggest that 5‐HT is more potent in this respect than NA."

A topical organization has been demonstrated: Lesions dorsal in the entorhinal area evoke terminal degeneration in antero‐rostral (septal) parts of the hippocampus only. More ventral lesions produce degeneration in increasingly caudal (temporal) segments of the hippocampus. Earlier descriptions of the route traversed by the perforant path have been confirmed. In addition, the axons to the most rostral parts of the hippocampus and fascia dentata have been shown to course superficially in the dorsal and rostral parts of the subiculum and CA1 which form an exposed part of the medial aspect of the hemisphere."

The major findings can be summarized as follows. Whereas the projection of the lateral entorhinal area (LEA) to the dentate gyrus is broad in its longitudinal extent, the medial entorhinal area (MEA), and especially the ventral portion of this zone, projects in a more lamellar fashion. In the transverse plane the LEA preferentially projects to the inner (dorsal) blade of the dentate gyrus, while the MEA innervates both blades equally. Within the radial dimension, the entorhinal cortex projects to the dentate gyrus according to a medial to lateral gradient, with lateral portions of the LEA projecting along the pial surface and successively more medial portions of the entorhinal projecting closer to the granule cells. The commissural entorhinal to dentate projections are similar to the ipsilateral projections in location; however, they are considerably reduced in septotemporal extent and do not arise from cells in the ventral half of either LEA or the intermediate entorhinal area (IEA). The projection of the entorhinal cortex to Ammon's horn reflects the same longitudinal characteristics as the denate projections. An alvear input which extends only to the pyramidal cells at the CA<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>‐subicular junction was most noticeable at ventral hippocampal levels. Finally the extrahippocampal projections have been analyzed. These arise predominantly from cells in the LEA and project forward along the angular bundle to the piriform and periamygdaloid cortices, as well as the endopiriform nucleus, the lateral, basolateral, and cortical amygdaloid nuclei, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, the olfactory tubercle, the anterior olfactory nucleus, the taenia tecta, and the indusium griseum. These extrinsic projections are to a large extent reciprocal to the major extrinsic inputs to the LEA."

Goddard,1983.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Stimulation of the contralateral hippocampus in the hilar region had a marked effect on granule cell excitability in the fascia dentata. The primary effect was to block the population spike that otherwise occurred in response to perforant path stimulation. In contrast, the size of the excitatory post‐synaptic potential component of the perforant path‐evoked field potential was only slightly reduced. The population spike diminution began at short latency (3.5 msec), beginning at about 1.0 msec after the onset of the slow component of the potential evoked by the contralateral stimulus. The completeness and duration of this population spike diminution depended on the contralateral stimulus intensity. The maximum duration was less than 40 msec in unanesthetized rats and more than 100 msec in rats under pento‐barbital anaesthesia. Bicuculline did not diminish the field potential evoked bythe contralateral stimulus but it did prevent the stimulus from blocking the perforant path population spike and, instead, permitted a weak facilitation of the population spike. The normal reduction of the population spike was not mediated by recurrent inhibition, secondary to granule cell activation, since it occurred whether or not the granule cells were inhibited at the time of contralateral stimulation. These results imply that the initial main effect on fascia dentata granule cells of activity in the contralateral hilus is a γ‐aminobutyric‐acid‐mediated inhibition. This effect most probably involves commissural excitation of local inhibitory interneurons. The direct excitatory action of commissural fibers on granule cells, by comparison, is very weak."

We found that practicing one task did not improve performance in an alternative task, even though both tasks used exactly the same visual stimuli but depended on different stimulus attributes (either orientation of local elements or global shape). Moreover, even when the experiment was designed so that the same responses were associated with the same stimuli (although subjects were instructed to attend to the attribute underlying one task), learning did not transfer from one task to the other. These results suggest that specific high-level attentional mechanisms, controlling changes at early visual processing levels, are essential in perceptual learning."

We argue that the retinal goal is to transform the visual input as much as possible into a statistically independent basis as the first step in creating a redundancy reduced representation in the cortex, as suggested by Barlow. The extent of this whitening of the input is limited, however, by the need to suppress input noise. Our explicit theoretical solutions for the retinal filters also show a simple dependence on mean stimulus luminance: they predict an approximate Weber law at low spatial frequencies and a De Vries-Rose law at high frequencies. Assuming that the dominant source of noise is quantum, we generate a family of contrast sensitivity curves as a function of mean luminance. This family is compared to psychophysical data. "

The problem of the interhemispheric transfer of visual information in humans has been approached psychophysically, making use of a visual discrimination task that shows a clear left field advantage and is subject to the phenomenon of perceptual learning. 2. For this task (discrimination of complex gratings differing only by the relative spatial phase of their harmonic components) there is a left field advantage and a lack of interhemispheric transfer of learning effects at all spatial frequencies tested for stimuli removed at least 5 deg from either side of the vertical meridian. 3. For stimuli close to the vertical meridian, the left field advantage disappears and there is a complete transfer of learning effects, provided the fundamental spatial frequency is 2 cycles/deg or lower. 4. At higher spatial frequencies the left field advantage is maintained and the learning effects do not transfer from one visual hemifield to the other, even at +/‐ 0.5 deg from the vertical meridian, unless the contrast is very high. 5. The transfer of learning effects obtained for spatial frequencies of 2 cycles/deg or lower is peculiar to regions placed close to the vertical meridian and symmetrically located on either side of it. No transfer is obtained between non‐overlapping regions on the same side of the vertical meridian. 6. These findings are consistent with an interhemispheric transfer of visual information, preferential for low spatial frequencies and high contrasts, in agreement with that found for callosal transfer in the cat (Berardi, Bisti &amp; Maffei, 1987)."

Previous studies have provided evidence that the patches formed by horizontal connections exhibit modular specificity, preferentially linking columns of neurons with similar response characteristics, such as preferred orientation. The issue of how these connections are distributed with respect to the topographic map of visual space, however, has not been resolved. Here we combine optical imaging of intrinsic signals with small extracellular injections of biocytin to assess quantitatively the specificity of horizontal connections with respect to both the map of orientation preference and the map of visual space in tree shrew V1. Our results indicate that horizontal connections outside a radius of 500 μm from the injection site exhibit not only modular specificity, but also specificity for axis of projection. Labeled axons extend for longer distances, and give off more terminal boutons, along an axis in the map of visual space that corresponds to the preferred orientation of the injection site. Inside of 500 μm, the pattern of connections is much less specific, with boutons found along every axis, contacting sites with a wide range of preferred orientations. The system of long-range horizontal connections can be summarized as preferentially linking neurons with co-oriented, co-axially aligned receptive fields. These observations suggest specific ways that horizontal circuits contribute to the response properties of layer 2/3 neurons and to mechanisms of visual perception."

Physiological recordings in mammals indicate that circuits develop over a period that extends well into early postnatal ages (LeVay et al., 1980; Albus and Wolf, 1984). Our understanding of how these circuits are assembled during development is still fragmentary (Katz and Callaway, 1992). Here we describe the development of local connections within visual cortex, using the fluorescent dye 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate to trace axonal projections in post-mortem human brains. Vertical (intracolumnar) connections between layers 2/3 and 5, which link neurons representing the same point in the visual field, develop prenatally at 26–29 weeks gestation. In contrast, horizontal (intercolumnar) connections between different points in the visual field develop later. They first emerge prenatally at approximately 37 weeks gestation within layers 4B and 5. After birth (&gt; 40 weeks gestation) the fiber density increases rapidly, showing a uniform plexus of connections at 7 weeks postnatal. The more adult-like patchiness of the projection, however, emerges after 8 weeks postnatal. Long-range horizontal connections within layer 2/3 develop after the connections within layers 4B, 5, and 6. These connections emerge after 16 weeks postnatal, long after cytochrome oxidase blobs have developed, and reach mature from sometime before 15 months of age. Unlike the patchy horizontal projections within layers 4B and 5, which seem to develop through a process of collateral elimination, long-range projections within layer 2/3 are patchy from the outset and seem to develop with greater topographical precision. The finding that intracolumnar connections develop before intercolumnar projections suggests that circuits that process local features of a visual scene develop before circuits necessary to integrate these features into a continuous and coherent neural representation of an image. In addition, the sequential development of horizontal connections within layer 4B before those within layer 2/3 suggests that circuits that may be related to the processing channel for visual motion develop in advance of those that may be more intimately related to the processing of form, color, and precise stereoscopic depth."

Tweedale,1991.0,"<jats:p> 1. Acute effects of permanent and temporary denervation of the flying fox thumb were examined to test the hypothesis that a large area of skin around the cutaneous receptive field of multiunits (MRF) at a locus in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) supplies viable inputs which can be rapidly unmasked by interruption of the dominant input from the area of the MRF. 2. The immediate effect of amputation of the thumb at loci where the original receptive field was entirely removed was to produce large MRFs on adjacent body areas (wrist, forearm, prowing, and finger membranes). Greatly expanded MRFs were also produced when amputation removed only part of the original MRF at a cortical locus. 3. The probable source of input to account for the new receptive fields is the extensive arborization of ascending projections within the somatosensory pathway, which supply a cortical locus with a potential input from a far larger area than is represented in its normal receptive field. The rapidity with which new or expanded fields are seen following denervation indicates that the normally unexpressed inputs around a receptive field are not only potential inputs but are inherently viable. Hence the most likely explanation for the results of this study is that the effect of the denervation is to disrupt an inhibitory influence that normally has the role of shaping the receptive field. 4. Temporary anesthesia of all or part of a MRF produced similar initial effects to amputation. When responsiveness returned to the locally anesthetized area (after 10-30 min), an expanded MRF persisted for a short time after which the boundaries of the MRF shrank. This rapid reversal suggests that a mechanistic rather than a plastic change is the basis for the acute effect of a small denervation on SI. "

These collaterals form periodic “clusters” of finer axon branches that link columns of similar orientation selectivity. We have investigated the sequence of events and possible mechanisms underlying the development of these clustered intrinsic horizontal connections using a combination of neuronal tracers and intracellular staining. Small injections of fluorescent latex microspheres made during the first postnatal week (at P4–6), when examined in tangential sections, produced an even, unclustered distribution of retrogradely labeled cells up to 2 mm from the injection site. At P8, retrograde labeling extended over a larger area and clustering was discernible, primarily among the most distant labeled cells. At both P6 and P8, labeling was similar in layers 2/3 and 5, indicating that the transition from clustered to unclustered connections occurred simultaneously for cells in superficial and deep laminae. By the end of the second postnatal week (P12–15), retrogradely labeled cells were far more clustered both within and beyond the extent of P6 label; the density of labeled cells was high throughout the labeled region, but much higher within clusters. The periodicity of these nascent clusters was similar to that in the adult. Despite obvious clustering, the pattern of retrograde label observed following injections at 2–3 weeks (P12–21) differed markedly from the adult, in that the regions between clusters contained many labeled cells. Over the next 3 weeks, the connections were refined, so that by the sixth postnatal week (P36–38), regions between clusters contained very few retrogradely labeled cells and the overall pattern of retrograde label was indistinguishable from that in adults. Despite differences in postmigratory ages of neurons from the superficial and deep laminae, clustering of retrogradely labeled cells from these 2 populations was similar at all ages. Experiments in which 2–3 weeks elapsed between the time microsphere injections were made and animals were killed demonstrated that neither the initial formation of crude clusters nor their refinement was due to cell death. Instead, cluster refinement resulted from specific process elimination. When a red microsphere injection at P15 was followed by a green microsphere injection at exactly the same location on P29, the earlier injection resulted in crude clustering, as expected. Virtually all of the cells double-labeled by the later injection were within the densest clusters of label from the early injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Extracellular single-cell recording techniques were employed to investigate the effects of ocular misalignment on the postnatal development of the spatial response properties of striate cortical neurons. The primary objective of the study was to gain insight into the neural basis of strabismic amblyopia. 2. Two basic rearing strategies were used to study specific aspects of experimental strabismus in developing kittens. In one group, strabismus was optically induced by fitting kittens with goggles that held a 15-diopter base-in prism in front of one eye (MP) or both eyes (BP) between the ages of 4 wk and 4 mo. In the second group, a unilateral esotropia was surgically induced at 3 wks of age either by the simple resection of the lateral rectus muscle tendon (tenotomy) or by a more drastic procedure that involved removing sections of the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles (myectomy). In addition, the eyelids of the nondeviating eyes of these kittens were sutured closed (ESO/MD). The first rearing paradigm isolated the effects of conflicting visual inputs on neural development, whereas the second procedure isolated the effects of anomalous ocular motility by producing a misalignment without putting the deviated eye at a competitive disadvantage. 3. The recording experiments were conducted when the animals were greater than or equal to 9 mo of age. A total of 445 striate cortical neurons were isolated and quantitatively studied in 17 cats (3 MPs, 3 BPs, 5 ESO/MDs, 3 goggle-reared controls, and 3 normals). In addition, we analyzed the distribution of preferred stimulus orientations of 1,205 single units that had been studied qualitatively in our previous investigation of 42 kittens reared with optically induced strabismus. 4. As expected, the proportion of binocularly driven units was reduced in both MP and BP cats. The great majority of units in ESO/MD animals were exclusively driven or highly dominated by the open deviating eye. 5. Prism-reared animals showed physiological deficits in spatial resolution, contrast sensitivity, contrast gain, and peak firing rate. These effects were manifest in both eyes, although there was always an interocular asymmetry in the deficits observed in the two eyes. In MP animals, the units dominated by the treated eye, which was contralateral to the recording hemisphere, were on the average more severely affected. The interocular asymmetry was smaller in BP cats; however, two of the three BP animals also showed a greater deficit in those units dominated by the contralateral eye.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

Compared with traditional volume‐based intersubject averages, averages made using computational models of the cortical surface have the potential to increase statistical power because they reduce intersubject variability in cortical folding patterns. We describe a two‐step method for creating intersubject surface averages. In the first step cortical surface models are created for each subject and the locations of the anterior and posterior commissures (AC and PC) are aligned. In the second step each surface is standardized to contain the same number of nodes with identical indexing. An anatomical average from 28 subjects created using the AC–PC technique showed greater sulcal and gyral definition than the corresponding volume‐based average. When applied to an fMRI dataset, the AC–PC method produced greater maximum, median, and mean <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>‐statistics in the average activation map than did the volume average and gave a better approximation to the theoretical‐ideal average calculated from individual subjects. The AC–PC method produced average activation maps equivalent to those produced with surface‐averaging methods that use high‐dimensional morphing. In comparison with morphing methods, the AC–PC technique does not require selection of a template brain and does not introduce deformations of sulcal and gyral patterns, allowing for group analysis within the original folded topology of each individual subject.

Psychophysical evidence indicated that stimuli at validly cued locations were responded to faster than stimuli at invalidly cued locations. Reaction times to invalid probes were faster when they were presented in the same than in the opposite direction of an ongoing attention movement. PET evidence indicated that superior parietal and superior frontal cortex were more active when attention was shifted to peripheral locations than when maintained at the center of gaze. Both regions encoded the visual field and not the direction of an attention shift. In the right superior parietal lobe, two distinct responses were localized for attention to left and right visual field. Finally, the superior parietal region was active when peripheral locations were selected on the basis of cognitive or sensory cues independent of the execution of an overt response. The frontal region was active only when responses were made to stimuli at selected peripheral locations. These findings indicate that parietal and frontal regions control different aspects of spatial selection. The functional asymmetry in superior parietal cortex may be relevant for the pathophysiology of unilateral neglect."

Three commonly observed neuronal effects in memory-demanding tasks are repetition suppression, enhancement, and delay activity. In repetition suppression, repeated experience with the same visual stimulus leads to both short- and long-term suppression of neuronal responses in subpopulations of visual neurons. Enhancement works in an opposite fashion, in that neuronal responses are enhanced for objects with learned behavioral relevance. Delay activity is found in tasks in which animals are required to actively hold specific information “on-line” for short periods. Repetition suppression appears to be an intrinsic property of visual cortical areas such as inferior temporal cortex and is thought to be important for perceptual learning and priming. By contrast, enhancement and delay activity may depend on feedback to temporal cortex from prefrontal cortex and are thought to be important for working memory. All of these mnemonic effects on neuronal responses bias the competitive interactions that take place between stimulus representations in the cortex when there is more than one stimulus in the visual field. As a result, memory will often determine the winner of these competitions and, thus, will determine which stimulus is attended."

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a motor sequence learning paradigm in humans, we found evidence of an experience-dependent shift of activation from the cerebellar cortex to the dentate nucleus during early learning, and from a cerebellar–cortical to a striatal–cortical network with extended practice. The results indicate that intrinsic modulation within the cerebellum, in concert with activation of motor-related cortical regions, serves to set up a procedurally acquired sequence of movements that is then maintained elsewhere in the brain."

Goldstone,1998.0,"<jats:p>▪ Abstract  Perceptual learning involves relatively long-lasting changes to an organism's perceptual system that improve its ability to respond to its environment. Four mechanisms of perceptual learning are discussed: attention weighting, imprinting, differentiation, and unitization. By attention weighting, perception becomes adapted to tasks and environments by increasing the attention paid to important dimensions and features. By imprinting, receptors are developed that are specialized for stimuli or parts of stimuli. By differentiation, stimuli that were once indistinguishable become psychologically separated. By unitization, tasks that originally required detection of several parts are accomplished by detecting a single constructed unit representing a complex configuration. Research from cognitive psychology, psychophysics, neuroscience, expert/novice differences, development, computer science, and cross-cultural differences is described that relates to these mechanisms. The locus, limits, and applications of perceptual learning are also discussed."

We report remarkable long-term learning in a simple texture discrimination task where learning is specific for retinal input. This learning is (i) local (in a retinotopic sense), (ii) orientation specific but asymmetric (it is specific for background but not for target-element orientation), and (iii) strongly monocular (there is little interocular transfer of learning). Our results suggest that learning involves experience-dependent changes at a level of the visual system where monocularity and the retinotopic organization of the visual input are still retained and where different orientations are processed separately. These results can be interpreted in terms of local plasticity induced by retinal input in early visual processing in human adults, presumably at the level of orientation-gradient sensitive cells in primary visual cortex."

Here we report an increase in the cortical area of representation of a restricted frequency range in primary auditory cortex of adult owl monkeys that is correlated with the animal's performance at a frequency discrimination task. Monkeys trained for several weeks to discriminate small differences in the frequency of sequentially presented tonal stimuli revealed a progressive improvement in performance with training. At the end of the training period, the tonotopic organization of Al was defined by recording multiple-unit responses at 70-258 cortical locations. These responses were compared to those derived from three normal monkeys and from two monkeys that received the same auditory stimuli but that were engaged in a tactile discrimination task. The cortical representation, the sharpness of tuning, and the latency of the response were greater for the behaviorally relevant frequencies of trained monkeys when compared to the same frequencies of control monkeys. The cortical area of representation was the only studied parameter that was correlated with behavioral performance. These results demonstrate that attended natural stimulation can modify the tonotopic organization of Al in the adult primate, and that this alteration is correlated with changes in perceptual acuity."

The distributed responses of cortical neurons (""maps"") of the hand surfaces were defined in detail in somatosensory cortical area 3b. Representations of trained hands were compared with those of the opposite, untrained hand, and to the area 3b representations of hands in a second set of monkeys that were stimulated tactually in the same manner while these monkeys were attending to auditory stimuli (passive stimulation controls). 3. The cortical representations of the trained hands were substantially more complex in topographic detail than the representations of unstimulated hands or of passively stimulated control hands. 4. In all well-trained monkeys the representations of the restricted skin location trained in the behavioral task were significantly (1.5 to greater than 3 times) greater in area than were the representations of equivalent skin locations on control digits. However, the overall extents of the representations of behaviorally stimulated fingers were not larger than those of control fingers in the same hemisphere, or in opposite hemisphere controls. 5. The receptive fields representing the trained skin were significantly larger than receptive fields representing control digits in all but one trained monkey. The largest receptive fields were centered in the zone of representation of the behaviorally engaged skin, but they were not limited to it. Large receptive fields were recorded in a 1- to 2-mm-wide zone in the area 3b maps of trained hands. 6. Receptive-field sizes were also statistically significantly larger on at least one adjacent, untrained digit when compared with the receptive fields recorded on the homologous digit of the opposite hand. 7.

Maunsell,2002.0,"<jats:p> Performance in visual discrimination tasks improves with practice. Although the psychophysical parameters of these improvements have suggested the involvement of early areas in visual cortex, there has been little direct study of the physiological correlates of such perceptual learning at the level of individual neurons. To examine how neuronal response properties in the early visual system may change with practice, we trained monkeys for more than 6 mo in an orientation discrimination task in which behaviorally relevant stimuli were restricted to a particular retinal location and oriented around a specific orientation. During training the monkeys' discrimination thresholds gradually improved to much better than those of naive monkeys or humans. Although this improvement was specific to the trained orientation, it showed little retinotopic specificity. The receptive field properties of single neurons from regions representing the trained location and a location in the opposite visual hemifield were measured in V1 and V2. In most respects the receptive field properties in the representations of the trained and untrained regions were indistinguishable. However, in the regions of V1 and V2 representing the trained location, there were slightly fewer neurons whose optimal orientation was near the trained orientation. This resulted in a small but significant decrease in the V1 population response to the trained orientation at the trained location. Consequently, the observed neuronal populations did not exhibit any orientation-specific biases sufficient to explain the orientation specificity of the behavioral improvement. Pooling models suggest that the behavioral improvement was accomplished with a task-dependent and orientation-selective pooling of unaltered signals from early visual neurons. These data suggest that, even for training with stimuli suited to the selectivities found in early areas of visual cortex, behavioral improvements can occur in the absence of pronounced changes in the physiology of those areas.

Although psychophysical studies suggest that perceptual learning induces similar changes in primary visual cortex (V1), studies that have measured the response properties of individual neurons have failed to find effects of the size described for the other sensory systems. We have examined the effect of learning on neuronal response properties in a visual area that lies at a later stage of cortical processing, area V4. Adult macaque monkeys were trained extensively on orientation discrimination at a specific retinal location using a narrow range of orientations. During the course of training, the subjects achieved substantial improvement in orientation discrimination that was primarily restricted to the trained location. After training, neurons in V4 with receptive fields overlapping the trained location had stronger responses and narrower orientation tuning curves than neurons with receptive fields in the opposite, untrained hemifield. The changes were most prominent for neurons that preferred orientations close to the trained range of orientations. These results provide the first demonstration of perceptual learning modifying basic neuronal response properties at an intermediate level of visual cortex and give insights into the distribution of plasticity across adult visual cortex."

A computer-driven stimulator was used to make quantitative tests of selectivity for stimulus direction, speed, and orientation. The data were taken from 168 units that were histologically identified as being in MT. 2. The results confirm previous reports of a high degree of direction selectivity in MT. The response above background to stimuli moving in a unit's preferred direction was, an average, 10.9 times that to stimuli moving in the opposite direction. There was a marked tendency for nearby units to have similar preferred directions. 3. Most units were also sharply tuned for the speed of stimulus motion. For some cells the response fell to less than half-maximal at speeds only a factor of two from the optimum; on average, responses were greater than half-maximal only over a 7.7-fold range of speed. The distribution of preferred speeds for different units was unimodal, with a peak near 32 degrees/s; the total range of preferred speeds extended from 2 to 256 degrees/s. Nearby units generally responded best to similar speeds of motion. 4. Most units in MT showed selectivity for stimulus orientation when tested with stationary, flashed bars. However, stationary stimuli generally elicited only brief responses; when averaged over the duration of the stimulus, the responses were much less than those to moving stimuli. The preferred orientation was usually, but not always, perpendicular to the preferred direction of movement. 5. A comparison of the results of the present study with a previous quantitative investigation in the owl monkey shows a striking similarity in response properties in MT of the two species. 6. The presence of both direction and speed selectivity in MT of the macaque suggests that this area is more specialized for the analysis of visual motion than has been previously recognized. "

Movshon,1996.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We have previously documented the exquisite motion sensitivity of neurons in extrastriate area MT by studying the relationship between their responses and the direction and strength of visual motion signals delivered to their receptive fields. These results suggested that MT neurons might provide the signals supporting behavioral choice in visual discrimination tasks. To approach this question from another direction, we have now studied the relationship between the discharge of MT neurons and behavioral choice, independently of the effects of visual stimulation. We found that trial-to-trial variability in neuronal signals was correlated with the choices the monkey made. Therefore, when a directionally selective neuron in area MT fires more vigorously, the monkey is more likely to make a decision in favor of the preferred direction of the cell. The magnitude of the relationship was modest, on average, but was highly significant across a sample of 299 cells from four monkeys. The relationship was present for all stimuli (including those without a net motion signal), and for all but the weakest responses. The relationship was reduced or eliminated when the demands of the task were changed so that the directional signal carried by the cell was less informative. The relationship was evident within 50 ms of response onset, and persisted throughout the stimulus presentation. On average, neurons that were more sensitive to weak motion signals had a stronger relationship to behavior than those that were less sensitive. These observations are consistent with the idea that neuronal signals in MT are used by the monkey to determine the direction of stimulus motion. The modest relationship between behavioral choice and the discharge of any one neuron, and the prevalence of the relationship across the population, make it likely that signals from many neurons are pooled to form the data on which behavioral choices are based."

We investigated the role of MT in visual perception by examining the effect of chemical lesions of MT on psychophysical thresholds. We trained rhesus monkeys on psychophysical tasks that enabled us to assess their sensitivity to motion and to contrast. For motion psychophysics, we employed a dynamic random dot display that permitted us to vary the intensity of a motion signal in the midst of masking motion noise. We measured the threshold intensity for which the monkey could successfully complete a direction discrimination. In the contrast task, we measured the threshold contrast for which the monkeys could successfully discriminate the orientation of stationary gratings. Injections of ibotenic acid into MT caused striking elevations in motion thresholds, but had little or no effect on contrast thresholds. The results indicate that neural activity in MT contributes selectively to the perception of motion."

We studied reward-related activity in two monkeys performing a prosaccade/antisaccade task and in one monkey trained in memory prosaccades only. Two types of neurons were distinguished by their reciprocal firing pattern: reward-predicting (RP) and reward-detecting (RD). RP neurons linearly increased their firing as early as 150 ms before saccade onset until the occurrence of reward, at which time they abruptly ceased firing. In contrast, RD neurons fired in phase with reward delivery, even when its duration was varied and when it was repeated at different frequencies. RD discharges were little affected or unaffected by the position of a visual cue that briefly anchored the goal at the onset of reward. The complementary firing patterns of the RP and RD neurons could provide a feedback mechanism necessary for learning and performing the task. "

In the study reported here, we directly tested for response plasticity in striatal neurons of macaque monkeys undergoing Pavlovian conditioning. To focus the study, we recorded from the tonically active neurons (TANs) of the striatum, which are known to respond to conditioned sensory stimuli that signal reward delivery and elicit behavioral reactions. The activities of 858 TANs were recorded extracellularly from the striatum in alert behaving macaque monkeys before, during, and after the acquisition of a classical conditioning task. Two monkeys were trained to lick reward juice delivered on a spoon simultaneously with the presentation of a click. Almost no licks were triggered by the cues at the start of training, but by the fifth day more than 90% of licks were triggered, and values were near 100% for the remainder of the 3 week training period. In the striatum, only a small number of TANs responded to the clicks at the start before conditioning (about 17%). During training, the numbers of responding TANs gradually increased, so that by the end of training more than 50– 70% of the TANs recorded (51.3–73.5%) became responsive to the clicks. The responses consisted of a pause in firing that occurred approximately 90 msec after the click and that was in some cells preceded by a brief activation and in most cells was followed by a rebound excitation. Prolonged recordings from single TANs (n = 6) showed that individual TANs can acquire a conditioned response within at least as short a time as 10 min. TANs retained such responsiveness after overtraining, and also after a 4 week intermission in training. When the monkey was trained to receive rewards in relation to a new conditioning stimulus, TANs were capable of switching their sensory response to the new stimulus. Histological reconstruction showed that the TANs that became responsive were broadly distributed in the region of striatum explored, which included the dorsal half to two-thirds of the caudate nucleus and putamen over a large anteroposterior span. We conclude that, during the acquisition of a sensorimotor association, TANs widely distributed through the striatum become responsive to sensory stimuli that induce conditioned behavior. This distributed change in activity could serve to modulate the activity of surrounding projection neurons in the striatum engaged in mediating learned behavior."

Schultz,1992.0,"<jats:p> 1. This study investigated neuronal activity in the striatum preceding predictable environmental events and behavioral reactions. Monkeys performed in a delayed go-nogo task that included separate time periods during which animals expected signals of behavioral significance, prepared for execution or inhibition of arm reaching movements, and expected the delivery of reward. In the task, animals were instructed by a green light cue to perform an arm reaching movement when a trigger stimulus came on approximately 3 s later (go situation). Movement was withheld after the same trigger light when the instruction cue had been red (nogo situation). Liquid reward was delivered on correct performance in both situations. 2. A total of 1,173 neurons were studied in the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) of 3 animals, of which 615 (52%) showed some change in activity during task performance. This report describes how the activity of 193 task-related neurons increased in advance of at least 1 component of the task, namely the instruction cue, the trigger stimulus, or the delivery of liquid reward. These neurons were found in dorsal and anterior parts of caudate and putamen and were slightly more frequent in the proximity of the internal capsule. 3. The activity of 16 neurons increased in both go and nogo trials before the onset of the instruction and subsided shortly after this signal. These activations may be related to the expectation of the instruction as the first signal in each trial. 4. The activity of 15 neurons increased between the instruction and the trigger stimulus in both go and nogo trials. These activations may be related to the expectation of the trigger stimulus independent of an arm movement. Further 56 neurons showed sustained activations only when the instruction requested a movement reaction. Activations were absent in trials in which the movement was withheld. Twenty-one of these neurons were tested with 2 different movement targets, 5 of which showed activity related to the direction of movement. These activations may be related to the preparation of movement or expectation of the specific movement triggering signal. The activity of an additional 20 neurons was unmodulated before the trigger stimulus in movement trials but increased in the interval between the no-movement instruction and the trigger stimulus for withholding the movement. These activations may be related to the preparation of movement inhibition as specific nogo reaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

To chart the basal ganglia (BG) involvement in this association, we recorded the activity of 61 well isolated neurons in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) of two monkeys performing a probabilistic visuomotor task. Our results indicate that most (96%) neurons responded to multiple phases of the task. The activity of many (34%) pallidal neurons was modulated solely by direction of movement, and the activity of only a few (3%) pallidal neurons was modulated exclusively by reward prediction. However, the activity of a large number (41%) of single pallidal neurons was comodulated by both expected trial outcome and direction of arm movement. The information carried by the neuronal activity of single pallidal neurons dynamically changed as the trial progressed. The activity was predominantly modulated by both outcome prediction and future movement direction at the beginning of trials and became modulated mainly by movement-direction toward the end of trials. GPe neurons can either increase or decrease their discharge rate in response to predicted future reward. The effects of movement-direction and reward probability on neural activity are linearly summed and thus reflect two independent modulations of pallidal activity. We propose that GPe neurons are uniquely suited for independent processing of a multitude of parameters. This is enabled by the funnel-structure characteristic of the BG architecture, as well as by the anatomical and physiological properties of GPe neurons."

The results of neuropsychological, neuropharmacological, and neurophysiological experiments have implicated the ventral striatum in reward-related processes. We designed a task to allow us to separate the effects of sensory, motor, and internal signals so that we could study the correlation between the activity of neurons in the ventral striatum and different motivational states. In this task, a visual stimulus was used to cue the monkeys as to their progress toward earning a reward. The monkeys performed more quickly and with fewer mistakes in the rewarded trials. After analyzing the behavioral results from three monkeys, we recorded from 143 neurons from two of the monkeys while they performed the task with either juice or cocaine reward. 2. In this task the monkey was required to release its grip on a bar when a small visual response cue changed colors from red (the wait signal) to green (the go signal). The duration of the wait signal was varied randomly. The cue became blue whenever the monkey successfully responded to the go signal within 1 s of its appearance. A reward was delivered after the monkey successfully completed one, two, or three trials. The schedules were randomly interleaved. A second visual stimulus that progressively brightened or dimmed signaled to the monkeys their progress toward earning a reward. This discriminative cue allowed the monkeys to judge the proportion of work remaining in the current ratio schedule of reinforcement. Data were collected from three monkeys while they performed this task. 3. The average reaction times became faster and error rates declined as the monkeys progressed toward completing the current schedule of reinforcement and thereby earning a reward, whereas the modal reaction time did not change. As the duration of the wait period before the go signal increased, the monkeys reacted more quickly but their error rates scarcely changed. From these results we infer that the effects of motivation and motor readiness in this task are generated by separate mechanisms rather than by a single mechanism subserving generalized arousal. 4. The activity of 138 ventral striatal neurons was sampled in two monkeys while they performed the task to earn juice reward. We saw tonic changes in activity throughout the trials, and we saw phasic activity following the reward. The activity of these neurons was markedly different during juice-rewarded trials than during correctly performed trials when no reward was forthcoming (or expected). The responses also were weakly, but significantly, related to the proximity of the reward in the schedules requiring more than one trial. 5. The monkeys worked to obtain intravenous cocaine while we recorded 62 neurons. For 57 of the neurons, we recorded activity while the monkeys worked in blocks of trials during which they self-administered cocaine after blocks during which they worked for juice. Although fewer neurons responded to cocaine than to juice reward (19 vs. 33%), this difference was not significant. The neuronal response properties to cocaine and juice rewards were independent; that is, the responses when one was the reward one failed to predict the response when the other was the reward. In addition, the neuronal activity lost most of its selectivity for rewarded trials, i.e, the activity did not distinguish nearly as well between cocaine and sham rewards as between juice and sham rewards. 6. Our results show that mechanisms by which cocaine acts do not appear to be the same as the ones activated when the monkeys were presented with an oral juice reward. This finding raises the intriguing possibility that the effects of cocaine could be reduced selectively without blocking the effects of many natural rewards. "

The primate orbitofrontal cortex is the site of convergence of information from primary taste and primary olfactory cortical regions. In addition, it receives projections from temporal lobe visual areas concerned with the representation of objects such as foods. Previous work has shown that the responses of gustatory neurons in the secondary taste area within the orbitofrontal cortex are modulated by hunger and satiety, in that they stop responding to the taste of a food on which an animal has been fed to behavioral satiation, yet may continue to respond to the taste of other foods. 2. This study demonstrates a similar modulation of the responses of olfactory and visual orbitofrontal cortex neurons after feeding to satiety. Seven of nine olfactory neurons that were responsive to the odors of foods, such as blackcurrant juice, were found to decrease their responses to the odor of the satiating food in a selective and statistically significant manner. 3. It also was found for eight of nine neurons that had selective responses to the sight of food, that they demonstrated a sensory-specific reduction in their visual responses to foods after satiation. 4. The responses of orbitofrontal cortex neurons selective for foods in more than one modality also were analyzed before and after feeding to satiation. Satiety often affected the responses of these multimodal neurons across all modalities, but a sensory-specific effect was not always demonstrable for both modalities. 5. These findings show that the olfactory and visual representations of food, as well as the taste representation of food, in the primate orbitofrontal cortex are modulated by hunger. Usually a component related to sensory-specific satiety can be demonstrated. The findings link at least part of the processing of olfactory and visual information in this brain region to the control of feeding-related behavior. "

Cromwell; Wolfram Schultz,2003.0,"<jats:p> In behavioral science, it is well known that humans and nonhuman animals are highly sensitive to differences in reward magnitude when choosing an outcome from a set of alternatives. We know that a realm of behavioral reactions is altered when animals begin to expect different levels of reward outcome. Our present aim was to investigate how the expectation for different magnitudes of reward influences behavior-related neurophysiology in the anterior striatum. In a spatial delayed response task, different instruction pictures are presented to the monkey. Each image represents a different magnitude of juice. By reaching to the spatial location where an instruction picture was presented, animals could receive the particular liquid amount designated by the stimulus. Reliable preferences in reward choice trials and differences in anticipatory licks, performance errors, and reaction times indicated that animals differentially expected the various reward amounts predicted by the instruction cues. A total of 374 of 2,000 neurons in the anterior parts of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum showed five forms of task-related activation during the preparation or execution of movement and activations preceding or following the liquid drop delivery. Approximately one-half of these striatal neurons showed differing response levels dependent on the magnitude of liquid to be received. Results of a linear regression analysis showed that reward magnitude and single cell discharge rate were related in a subset of neurons by a monotonic positive or negative relationship. Overall, these data support the idea that the striatum utilizes expectancies that contain precise information concerning the predicted, forthcoming level of reward in directing general behavioral reactions.

Using distinct stimuli to indicate the probability of reward, we found that the phasic activation of dopamine neurons varied monotonically across the full range of probabilities, supporting past claims that this response codes the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward. In contrast, a previously unobserved response covaried with uncertainty and consisted of a gradual increase in activity until the potential time of reward. The coding of uncertainty suggests a possible role for dopamine signals in attention-based learning and risk-taking behavior.

Glimcher,2003.0,"<jats:p>In this provocative book, Paul Glimcher argues that economic theory may provide an alternative to the classical Cartesian model of the brain and behavior. Glimcher argues that Cartesian dualism operates from the false premise that the reflex is able to describe behavior in the real world that animals inhabit. A mathematically rich cognitive theory, he claims, could solve the most difficult problems that any environment could present, eliminating the need for dualism by eliminating the need for a reflex theory. Such a mathematically rigorous description of the neural processes that connect sensation and action, he explains, will have its roots in microeconomic theory. Economic theory allows physiologists to define both the optimal course of action that an animal might select and a mathematical route by which that optimal solution can be derived. Glimcher outlines what an economics-based cognitive model might look like and how one would begin to test it empirically. Along the way, he presents a fascinating history of neuroscience. He also discusses related questions about determinism, free will, and the stochastic nature of complex behavior.

Cromwell; Wolfram Schultz,2001.0,"<jats:p> This study investigated how different expected rewards influence behavior-related neuronal activity in the anterior striatum. In a spatial delayed-response task, monkeys reached for a left or right target and obtained a small quantity of one of two juices (apple, grenadine, orange, lemon, black currant, or raspberry). In each trial, an initial instruction picture indicated the behavioral target and predicted the reward. Nonmovement trials served as controls for movement relationships. Consistent preferences in special reward choice trials and differences in anticipatory licks, performance errors, and reaction times indicated that animals differentially expected the rewards predicted by the instructions. About 600 of &gt;2,500 neurons in anterior parts of caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum showed five forms of task-related activations, comprising responses to instructions, spatial or nonspatial activations during the preparation or execution of the movement, and activations preceding or following the rewards. About one-third of the neurons showed different levels of task-related activity depending on which liquid reward was predicted at trial end. Activations were either higher or lower for rewards that were preferred by the animals as compared with nonpreferred rewards. These data suggest that the expectation of an upcoming liquid reward may influence a fraction of task-related neurons in the anterior striatum. Apparently the information about the expected reward is incorporated into the neuronal activity related to the behavioral reaction leading to the reward. The results of this study are in general agreement with an account of goal-directed behavior according to which the outcome should be represented already at the time at which the behavior toward the outcome is performed.

The present paper reports complex neural activities in the monkey caudate nucleus that precede and anticipate visual stimuli and reward in learned visuomotor paradigms. These activities were revealed typically in the delayed saccade task in which memory and anticipation were required. We classified these activities according to their relationships to the task. 2. Activity related to expectation of a cue (n = 46) preceded the presentation of a spot of light (target cue) that signified the future location of saccade target. When the target cue was delayed, the activity was prolonged accordingly. The same spot of light was preceded by no activity if it acted as a distracting stimulus. 3. The sustained activity (n = 80) was a tonic discharge starting after the target cue as if holding the spatial information. 4. The activity related to expectation of target (n = 109) preceded the appearance of the target whose location was cued previously. It started with or after a saccade to the cued target location and ended with the appearance of the target. The activity was greater when the target was expected to appear in the contralateral visual field. 5. The activity related to expectation of reward (n = 57) preceded a task-specific reward. It started with the appearance of the final target and ended with the reward. In most cases, the activity was nonselective for how the monkey obtained the reward, i.e., by visual fixation only, by a saccade, or by a hand movement. The activity was dependent partly on visual fixation. 6. A few neurons showed tonic activity selectively before lever release and are thus considered to be related to the preparation of hand movements. 7. The activity related to breaking fixation (n = 33) occurred phasically if the monkey broke fixation, aborting the trial. 8. Activity related to reward (n = 104) was a phasic discharge that occurred before or after a reward of water was delivered. The activity was not simply related to a specific movement involved in the reward-obtaining behavior (eye, hand, or mouth movement). 9. Fixation-related activity (n = 72) was tonic activity continuing as long as the monkey attentively fixated a spot of light. It was dependent on reward expectancy in most cases. 10. The present results, together with those in the preceding papers, indicate that the activities of individual caudate neurons--sensory, motor, or cognitive--are dependent on specific contexts of learned behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

The paper gives a brief account of our previous and more recent theoretical contributions to the subject and also reports new recent data that support some aspects of our proposal on two major modes of communication in the central nervous system: the wiring and the volume transmission. There exist two competing theories on inter‐neuronal communication: the neuron doctrine and the theory of the diffuse nerve network, supported by Cajal and Golgi, respectively (see their respective Nobel Lectures). The present paper gives a brief account of a view on inter‐neuronal communication in the brain, the volume and wiring transmission concept that to a great extent reconcile these two theories. Thus, the theory of volume and wiring transmission are summarized and its recent developments that allow to extend these two modes of communication from the cellular network to the molecular network level is also briefly illustrated. The explanatory value of this broadened view is further enhanced by our recent proposal on the existence of a Global Molecular Network enmeshing the entire central nervous system. It may be interesting to note that also the Global Molecular Network theory is reminiscent of the old reticular theory of Apathy. Finally, the so‐called ‘tide hypothesis’ for diffusion of signals in the brain is briefly discussed and its possible extension to the molecular level is for the first time introduced. Early indirect evidence supporting volume transmission in the brain was the discovery of transmitter‐receptor mismatches. Thus, as an experimental part of the present paper a new approach to evaluate transmitter‐receptor mismatches is given and evidence for inter‐relationships between temperature micro‐gradients and mismatches is provided."

Tetanic stimulation produced a long- term synaptic depression (LTD) (&gt; 2 h) of both extracellularly recorded field potentials and intracellularly recorded EPSPs. LTD was not coupled with changes of intrinsic membrane properties of the recorded neurons. In some neurons, repetitive cortical activation produced a short-term posttetanic potentiation (1–3 min). Subthreshold tetanic stimulation, which under control condition did not cause LTD, induced LTD when associated with membrane depolarization. Moreover, LTD was not expressed in cells in which the conditioning tetanus was coupled with hyperpolarization of the membrane. Bath application of aminophosphonovalerate (30–50 microM), an antagonist of NMDA receptors, did not affect the amplitude of the synaptic potentials and the expression of LTD. Striatal LTD was significantly reduced by the pretreatment of the slices with 30 microM 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid, an antagonist of glutamate metabotropic receptors. LTD was not blocked by bicuculline (30 microM), a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. Scopolamine (3 microM), an antagonist of muscarinic receptors, induced a slight, but significant, increase of the amplitude of LTD. Both SCH 23390 (3 microM), an antagonist of D1 dopamine (DA) receptors, and I- sulpiride (1 microM), an antagonist of D2 DA receptors, blocked LTD. LTD was also absent in slices obtained from rats in which the nigrostriatal DA system was lesioned by unilateral nigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. In DA-depleted slices, LTD could be restored by applying exogenous DA (30 microM) before the conditioning tetanus. In DA-depleted slices, LTD could also be restored by coadministration of SKF 38393 (3–10 microM), a D1 receptor agonist, and of LY 171555 (1–3 microM), a D2 receptor agonist. Application of a single class of DA receptor agonists failed to restore LTD. These data show that striatal LTD requires three main physiological and pharmacological conditions: (1) membrane depolarization and action potential discharge of the postsynaptic cell during the conditioning tetanus, (2) activation of glutamate metabotropic receptors, and (3) coactivation of D1 and D2 DA receptors. Striatal LTD may alter the output signals from the striatum to the other structures of the basal ganglia. This form of synaptic plasticity can influence the striatal control of motor activity."

Disruption of the D2R gene function in mice results in a severe locomotor impairment. This phenotype has analogies with Parkinson’s disease symptoms. D2R-null mice were used to investigate the role of this receptor in the generation of striatal synaptic plasticity. Tetanic stimulation of corticostriatal fibers produced long-term depression (LTD) of EPSPs in slices from wild-type (WT) mice. Strikingly, recordings from D2R-null mice showed the converse: long-term potentiation (LTP). This LTP, unlike LTD, was blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist. In magnesium-free medium, LTP was also revealed in WT mice and found to be enhanced by<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>-sulpiride, a D2R antagonist, whereas it was reversed into LTD by LY 17555, a D2R agonist. In D2R-null mice this modulation was lost. Thus, our study indicates that D2Rs play a key role in mechanisms underlying the direction of long-term changes in synaptic efficacy in the striatum. It also shows that an imbalance between D2R and NMDA receptor activity induces altered synaptic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. This abnormal synaptic plasticity might cause the movement disorders observed in Parkinson’s disease."

Virtually all drugs of abuse activate dopaminergic systems, as do “natural” rewards such as sexual interaction and food. Sweet-tasting solutions, for example, are a well characterized natural reward. In the present experiments, we used mice that cannot make DA (DD mice) to test the hypothesis that DA is necessary for reward. Sucrose preference, assessed with a computerized “lickometer,” was used to determine whether DD mice respond preferentially for rewarding stimuli. DD mice preferentially chose sucrose over water, and also preferred the noncaloric sweetener saccharin. Furthermore, the rate of licking, bout size, and length were greater in DD mice drinking sweets than in controls. These data refute the necessity of DA for the reward processes manifested by sucrose preference. However, DD mice initiated licking less frequently than control mice and had fewer total licks. We suggest that DD mice have a deficit of goal-directed behavior that is not specific to reward processes. Lastly, juvenile DD mice demonstrate robust sucrose preference before experience with food in the presence of DA. Thus, DA is not required for mice to learn to consume sweet solutions preferentially. We conclude that DA is not required to find the sweet tastes of sucrose or saccharin rewarding."

After implantation of microdialysis cannulae, rats were food restricted and trained for three consecutive days with three acquisition sessions per day. A 10‐s noise (CS) was immediately followed by the delivery of two reward pellets (US) for the conditioned group (paired presentation), whereas conditioned stimuli and unconditioned stimuli were presented at random for the control group (unpaired presentation). On the fourth day, all rats were given a further CS + US session and two CS‐alone sessions, and extracellular dopamine concentrations were measured (7.5 min/per sample). Behavioural measures (number of nose pokes, latency to nose poke after conditioned stimuli onset, locomotor activity) demonstrated that the paired groups showed a high level of conditioning. CS + US presentation increased dopamine equally in both shell and core of the paired and unpaired groups. CS alone presentation induced a conditioned dopamine release only in the paired groups. No significant difference was found between shell and core. Unlike previous conditioning paradigms involving either a more salient US (foot shock, addictive drug) or a more complex CS, the present paradigm, using normal reward pellets as US and a discrete auditory stimulus as CS, did not lead to differential responses in dopamine efflux in shell and core subregions of the nucleus accumbens."

Numerous intermingled HCRT‐immunopositive and DβH‐immunopositive fibers were seen in a ventrally situated corridor extending from the hypothalamus to deep layers of the infralimbic cortex. Both fiber types avoided the nucleus accumbens core, caudate putamen, and the globus pallidus. In the diencephalon, overlap was observed in several hypothalamic areas, including the perifornical, dorsomedial, and paraventricular nuclei, as well as in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus. Intermingled HCRT‐containing and DβH‐containing fibers extended from the hypothalamus into areas within the medial and central amygdala, terminating at the medial border of the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala. Dense overlap between the two fiber types was also observed in the periaqueductal gray, particularly in the vicinity of the dorsal raphe, as well as (to a lesser extent) in the ventral tegmental area, the retrorubral field, and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Hypocretin‐containing cell bodies, located in the perifornical and lateral hypothalamus, were embedded within a dense plexus of DβH‐immunopositive fibers and boutons, with numerous cases of apparent contacts of DβH‐containing boutons onto HCRT‐immunopositive soma and dendrites. HCRT‐containing fibers were observed amid the noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus, and in the vicinity of the A1, A2, and A5 cell groups. Hence, the projections of these two arousal‐related systems, originating in distinctly different parts of the brain, jointly target several forebrain regions and brainstem monoaminergic nuclei involved in regulating core motivational processes.

These findings and others have led to hypotheses that propose that dopamine is rewarding, predicts that reinforcement will occur, or attributes incentive salience. Examining increases in dopamine in NAcc or striatum during sexual behavior in female rats provides a unique situation to study these relations. This is because, for the female rat, sexual behavior is associated with an increase in NAcc dopamine and conditioned place preference only under certain testing conditions. This experiment was conducted to determine what factors are important for the increase in dopamine in dialysate from NAcc and striatum during sexual behavior in female rats. The factors considered were the number of contacts by the male, the timing of contacts by the male, or the ability of the female to control contacts by the male. The results indicate that increased NAcc dopamine is dependent on the timing of copulatory stimuli, independent of whether the female rat is actively engaged in regulating this timing. For the striatum, the timing of copulatory behavior influences the magnitude of the increase in dopamine in dialysate, but other factors are also involved. We conclude that increased extracellular dopamine in the NAcc and striatum conveys qualitative or interpretive information about the rewarding value of stimuli. Sexual behavior in the female rat is proposed as a model to determine the role of dopamine in motivated behavior."

                        <jats:title>Background
</jats:title>
                        <jats:p>Excessive sequential stereotypy of behavioral patterns (sequential super-stereotypy) in Tourette's syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is thought to involve dysfunction in nigrostriatal dopamine systems. In sequential super-stereotypy, patients become trapped in overly rigid sequential patterns of action, language, or thought. Some instinctive behavioral patterns of animals, such as the syntactic grooming chain pattern of rodents, have sufficiently complex and stereotyped serial structure to detect potential production of overly-rigid sequential patterns. A syntactic grooming chain is a fixed action pattern that serially links up to 25 grooming movements into 4 predictable phases that follow 1 syntactic rule. New mutant mouse models allow gene-based manipulation of brain function relevant to sequential patterns, but no current animal model of spontaneous OCD-like behaviors has so far been reported to exhibit sequential super-stereotypy in the sense of a whole complex serial pattern that becomes stronger and excessively rigid. Here we used a hyper-dopaminergic mutant mouse to examine whether an OCD-like behavioral sequence in animals shows sequential super-stereotypy. Knockdown mutation of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT) causes extracellular dopamine levels in the neostriatum of these adult mutant mice to rise to 170% of wild-type control levels.

</jats:title>
                        <jats:p>We found that the serial pattern of this instinctive behavioral sequence becomes strengthened as an entire entity in hyper-dopaminergic mutants, and more resistant to interruption. Hyper-dopaminergic mutant mice have stronger and more rigid syntactic grooming chain patterns than wild-type control mice. Mutants showed sequential super-stereotypy in the sense of having more stereotyped and predictable syntactic grooming sequences, and were also more likely to resist disruption of the pattern en route, by returning after a disruption to complete the pattern from the appropriate point in the sequence. By contrast, wild-type mice exhibited weaker forms of the fixed action pattern, and often failed to complete the full sequence.

Previous studies have suggested that these cells also contribute to other efferent pathways which arise in the deep layers. The present study examines the contributions of the cells of origin of the predorsal bundle to these additional pathways as a step toward understanding their roles in gaze mechanisms. In one series of experiments, retrograde tracers were used to compare the laminar distribution of predorsal bundle cells with the distributions of the cells of origin of three other pathways: those that project to the intralaminar region of the dorsal thalamus, those that project to the contralateral superior colliculus, and those that project to the ipsilateral brainstem tegmentum. Predorsal bundle cells were found primarily in stratum griseum intermedium sublayer b. This distribution overlaps extensively with the distribution of colliculus cells that project to the intralaminar region of the thalamus. In contrast, the majority of the colliculus cells that project to either the contralateral superior colliculus or the ipsilateral brainstem tegmentum do not overlap extensively with the predorsal bundle cells; instead, they are primarily located dorsal or ventral to sublayer b of stratum griseum intermedium. In a second series of experiments, two regions were injected with different retrograde fluorescent tracers in single animals in order to study the collateral projections of the cells of origin of these pathways. The results indicate that many predorsal bundle cells project to the intralaminar region of the dorsal thalamus but that only a few contribute to the tectotectal pathway. The results also indicate that few tectotectal cells contribute to the ipsilateral tectobulbar pathway."

D1‐like and D2‐like DA receptors interact synergistically to allow LTD formation, while they operate in opposition during the induction phase of LTP.

In urethane‐anaesthetized rats, 63 pairs of extracellular recordings were obtained from neurons in the SC and ipsilateral ventral midbrain, before and after local disinhibitory injections of the GABA antagonist bicuculline (20–40 ng/200–400 nL saline) into the SC. Neurons recorded from substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area were classified as putative DA (25/63, 39.7%) or putative non‐DA (38/63, 60.3%). In nearly half the cases (27/63, 42.8%), chemical stimulation of the SC evoked a corresponding increase in neural activity in the ventral midbrain. This excitatory effect did not distinguish between DA and non‐DA neurons. In 6/63 cases (9.5%), SC activation elicited a reliable suppression of activity, while the remaining 30/63 cases (47.6%) were unaffected. In almost a third of cases (16/57, 28.1%) intense phasic activation of the SC was associated with correlated phasic activation of neurons in substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area.

The superior colliculus (SC) is also sensitive to such stimuli and sends a projection directly to DA‐containing regions of the ventral midbrain. Recent evidence suggests that the SC is a critical relay for transmitting short‐latency visual information to DA neurons. An important question is whether the ventral midbrain is an exclusive target of tectonigral neurons, or whether the tectonigral projection is a collateral branch of other tectofugal pathways. Double‐label retrograde anatomical tracing techniques were used to address this issue. Injections of either Diamidino Yellow or Fluorogold into substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) were combined with larger injections of True Blue into one of the following efferent projections of the SC: 1) target regions of the ipsilateral ascending projection to the thalamus; 2) the crossed descending tecto‐reticulo‐spinal pathway; 3) target structures of the ipsilateral descending projection; and 4) the contralateral superior colliculus. Moderate numbers of double‐labeled neurons were observed following combined injections into substantia nigra and individual nuclei in the thalamus (ventromedial nucleus, 21.3%; central lateral, 18.4%; parafasicular nucleus 6.0%). Much less double‐labeling was associated with injections into either of the descending projections (crossed, 1.0–3.2%; uncrossed, 0.2–2.7%) or the contralateral SC (0.7–1.9%). These results suggest: i) the SC may provide a coordinated input concerning the occurrence of unpredicted sensory events to both the substantia nigra and striatum (via the thalamus); and ii) few gaze‐related motor signals are simultaneously relayed to DA‐containing regions of the ventral midbrain.

Merzenich,1998.0,"<jats:p> ▪ Abstract  It has been clear for almost two decades that cortical representations in adult animals are not fixed entities, but rather, are dynamic and are continuously modified by experience. The cortex can preferentially allocate area to represent the particular peripheral input sources that are proportionally most used. Alterations in cortical representations appear to underlie learning tasks dependent on the use of the behaviorally important peripheral inputs that they represent. The rules governing this cortical representational plasticity following manipulations of inputs, including learning, are increasingly well understood. <jats:p> In parallel with developments in the field of cortical map plasticity, studies of synaptic plasticity have characterized specific elementary forms of plasticity, including associative long-term potentiation and long-term depression of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Investigators have made many important strides toward understanding the molecular underpinnings of these fundamental plasticity processes and toward defining the learning rules that govern their induction. The fields of cortical synaptic plasticity and cortical map plasticity have been implicitly linked by the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity underlies cortical map reorganization. Recent experimental and theoretical work has provided increasingly stronger support for this hypothesis. The goal of the current paper is to review the fields of both synaptic and cortical map plasticity with an emphasis on the work that attempts to unite both fields. A second objective is to highlight the gaps in our understanding of synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical representational plasticity. "

Donoghue,2000.0,"<jats:p>One fundamental function of primary motor cortex (MI) is to control voluntary movements. Recent evidence suggests that this role emerges from distributed networks rather than discrete representations and that in adult mammals these networks are capable of modification. Neuronal recordings and activation patterns revealed with neuroimaging methods have shown considerable plasticity of MI representations and cell properties following pathological or traumatic changes and in relation to everyday experience, including motor-skill learning and cognitive motor actions. The intrinsic horizontal neuronal connections in MI are a strong candidate substrate for map reorganization: They interconnect large regions of MI, they show activity-dependent plasticity, and they modify in association with skill learning. These findings suggest that MI cortex is not simply a static motor control structure. It also contains a dynamic substrate that participates in motor learning and possibly in cognitive events as well."

Learning occurs when the actual outcome differs from the predicted outcome, resulting in a prediction error. Neurons in several brain structures appear to code prediction errors in relation to rewards, punishments, external stimuli, and behavioral reactions. In one form, dopamine neurons, norepinephrine neurons, and nucleus basalis neurons broadcast prediction errors as global reinforcement or teaching signals to large postsynaptic structures. In other cases, error signals are coded by selected neurons in the cerebellum, superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, parietal cortex, striatum, and visual system, where they influence specific subgroups of neurons. Prediction errors can be used in postsynaptic structures for the immediate selection of behavior or for synaptic changes underlying behavioral learning. The coding of prediction errors may represent a basic mode of brain function that may also contribute to the processing of sensory information and the short-term control of behavior."

In view of their presumed role in determining behavioral and motivational relevance of incoming information we investigated whether the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are involved in auditory cortex learning. Using a chronic brain microdialysis technique over 4 days, samples from auditory cortex were obtained before, during, and after daily footshock avoidance training simultaneously from trained gerbils and passive control animals or pseudotrained animals. Because of detection limits of dopamine and serotonin in auditory cortex, the response profiles of extracellular homovanillic acid as the metabolite of the dopaminergic system and of 5‐hydroxyindoleacetic acid as the metabolite of the serotonergic system were determined from consecutive dialysis samples each day. The response of the dopaminergic system appeared to reflect the initial formation of the behaviorally relevant association exclusively during the first training day, whereas the serotonergic response appeared to correlate with the stress level of animals."

This hypothesis makes three assumptions: Synapses are modifiable, they modify with learning, and they strengthen through an LTP-like mechanism. We previously established the ability for synaptic modification and a synaptic strengthening with motor skill learning in horizontal connections of the rat motor cortex (MI). Here we investigated whether learning strengthened these connections through LTP. We demonstrated that synapses in the trained MI were near the ceiling of their modification range, compared with the untrained MI, but the range of synaptic modification was not affected by learning. In the trained MI, LTP was markedly reduced and LTD was enhanced. These results are consistent with the use of LTP to strengthen synapses during learning."

Merzenich,1998.0,"<jats:p>Little is known about the mechanisms that allow the cortex to selectively improve the neural representations of behaviorally important stimuli while ignoring irrelevant stimuli. Diffuse neuromodulatory systems may facilitate cortical plasticity by acting as teachers to mark important stimuli. This study demonstrates that episodic electrical stimulation of the nucleus basalis, paired with an auditory stimulus, results in a massive progressive reorganization of the primary auditory cortex in the adult rat. Receptive field sizes can be narrowed, broadened, or left unaltered depending on specific parameters of the acoustic stimulus paired with nucleus basalis activation. This differential plasticity parallels the receptive field remodeling that results from different types of behavioral training. This result suggests that input characteristics may be able to drive appropriate alterations of receptive fields independently of explicit knowledge of the task. These findings also suggest that the basal forebrain plays an active instructional role in representational plasticity."

The location of a salient target is identified through a spatiotemporal evolution of visually evoked activation throughout the visual system. Selection of the target leads to stochastic growth of movement-related activity toward a fixed threshold to generate the gaze shift. For a given image, the neural concomitants of perceptual processing occupy a relatively constant interval so that stochastic variability in response generation introduces additional variability in reaction times.

The most striking progress in this area has been made in studies of visual-saccadic decision making, a system that is becoming a model for understanding decision making in general. In this system, theoretical models of efficient decision making developed in the social sciences are beginning to be used to describe the computations the brain must perform when it connects sensation and action. Guided in part by these economic models, neurophysiologists have been able to describe neuronal activity recorded from the brains of awake-behaving primates during actual decision making. These recent studies have examined the neural basis of decisions, ranging from those made in predictable sensorimotor tasks to those unpredictable decisions made when animals are engaged in strategic conflict. All of these experiments seem to describe a surprisingly well-integrated set of physiological mechanisms that can account for a broad range of behavioral phenomena. This review presents many of these recent studies within the emerging neuroeconomic framework for understanding primate decision making."

We tested this hypothesis by measuring the effects of cortical microstimulation on perceptual judgements of motion direction. To accomplish this, rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate the direction of motion in a near-threshold, stochastic motion display. For each experiment, we positioned a microelectrode in the middle of a cluster of neurons that shared a common preferred direction of motion. The psychophysical task was then adjusted so that the visual display was presented directly over the neurons' receptive field. The monkeys were required to discriminate between motion shown either in the direction preferred by the neurons or in the opposite direction. On half the trials of an experiment, we applied electrical microstimulation while monkeys viewed the motion display. We hypothesized that enhancing the neurons' discharge rate would introduce a directionally specific signal into the cortex and thereby influence the monkeys' choices on the discrimination task. We compared the monkeys' performance on “stimulated” and “nonstimulated” trials in 139 experiments; all trials within an experiment were presented in random order. Statistically significant effects of microstimulation were obtained in 89 experiments. In 86 of the 89 experiments with significant effects (97%), the monkeys indicated that motion was in the neurons' preferred direction more frequently on stimulated trials than on nonstimulated trials. The data demonstrate a functional link between the activity of direction selective neurons and perceptual judgements of motion direction."

Newsome,2001.0,"<jats:p>We recorded the activity of single neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (area LIP) of two rhesus monkeys while they discriminated the direction of motion in random-dot visual stimuli. The visual task was similar to a motion discrimination task that has been used in previous investigations of motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate cortex. The monkeys were trained to decide whether the direction of motion was toward one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the random-dot stimulus. At the end of the trial, the monkeys reported their direction judgment by making an eye movement to the appropriate target. We studied neurons in LIP that exhibited spatially selective persistent activity during delayed saccadic eye movement tasks. These neurons are thought to carry high-level signals appropriate for identifying salient visual targets and for guiding saccadic eye movements. We arranged the motion discrimination task so that one of the choice targets was in the LIP neuron's response field (RF) while the other target was positioned well away from the RF. During motion viewing, neurons in LIP altered their firing rate in a manner that predicted the saccadic eye movement that the monkey would make at the end of the trial. The activity thus predicted the monkey's judgment of motion direction. This predictive activity began early in the motion-viewing period and became increasingly reliable as the monkey viewed the random-dot motion. The neural activity predicted the monkey's direction judgment on both easy and difficult trials (strong and weak motion), whether or not the judgment was correct. In addition, the timing and magnitude of the response was affected by the strength of the motion signal in the stimulus. When the direction of motion was toward the RF, stronger motion led to larger neural responses earlier in the motion-viewing period. When motion was away from the RF, stronger motion led to greater suppression of ongoing activity. Thus the activity of single neurons in area LIP reflects both the direction of an impending gaze shift and the quality of the sensory information that instructs such a response. The time course of the neural response suggests that LIP accumulates sensory signals relevant to the selection of a target for an eye movement."

We also explored the relationship between response magnitude and response variance for these cells and found, in general agreement with other investigators, that this relationship conforms to a power law with an exponent slightly greater than 1. The variance of the cells' discharge is little influenced by the trial-to-trial fluctuations inherent in our stochastic display, and is therefore likely to be of neural origin. Linear responses to these stochastic motion stimuli are predicted by simple, low-level motion models incorporating sensors having relatively broad spatial and temporal frequency tuning."

The model reveals how stimulus information guides decisions and shows how the information is processed through time to yield sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect decisions. Rapid two-choice decisions yield multiple empirical measures: response times for correct and error responses, the probabilities of correct and error responses, and a variety of interactions between accuracy and response time that depend on instructions and task difficulty. The diffusion model can explain all these aspects of the data for the four experiments we present. The model correctly accounts for error response times, something previous models have failed to do. Variability within the decision process explains how errors are made, and variability across trials correctly predicts when errors are faster than correct responses and when they are slower. "

Here we describe an initial study of neural responses in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the cerebral cortex while alert monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a visual display. A subset of LIP neurons carried high-level signals that may comprise a neural correlate of the decision process in our task. These signals are neither sensory nor motor in the strictest sense; rather they appear to reflect integration of sensory signals toward a decision appropriate for guiding movement. If this ultimately proves to be the case, several fascinating issues in cognitive neuroscience will be brought under rigorous physiological scrutiny."

In a reach-planning area of the posterior parietal cortex, neural activity was found to be more consistent with an eye-centered than an arm-centered coding of reach targets.

Monkeys were required to remember two target locations and then reach to them in sequence. Before the movements were executed, PRR neurons predominantly represented the reach about to be performed and only rarely represented the remembered target for the second reach. This indicates the area plays a role in specifying the target for the impending reach and may not contribute to storing the memory of subsequent reach targets."

The tasks were arm reaching 1) to foveated targets; 2) to extrafoveal targets, with constant eye position; 3) within an instructed-delayed paradigm, under both light and darkness; 4) saccadic eye movements toward, and static eye holding on peripheral targets; and 5) visual fixation and stimulation. The activity of many cells was modulated during arm reaction (68%) and movement time (58%), and during static holding of the arm in space (64%), when eye position was kept constant. Eye position influenced the activity of many cells during hand reaction (45%) and movement time (51%) and holding of hand static position (69%). Many cells (56%) were also modulated during preparation for hand movement, in the delayed reach task. Modulation was present also in the dark in 59% of cells during this epoch, 51% during reaction and movement time, and 48% during eye/hand holding on the target. Cells (50%) displaying light-dark differences of activity were considered as related to the sight and monitoring of hand motion and/or position in the visual field. Saccadic eye movements modulated a smaller percentage (25%) of cells than eye position (68%). Visual receptive fields were mapped in 44% of the cells studied. They were generally large and extended to the periphery of the tested (30°) visual field. Sixty-six percent of cells were motion sensitive. Therefore the activity of many neurons in this area reflects the combined influence of visual, eye, and arm movement–related signals. For most neurons, the orientation of the preferred directions computed across different epochs and tasks, therefore expression of all different eye- and hand-related activity types, clustered within a limited sector of space, the field of global tuning. These spatial fields might be an ideal frame to combine eye and hand signals, thanks to the congruence of their tuning properties. The relationships between cell activity and oculomotor and visuomanual behavior were task dependent. During saccades, most cells were recruited when the eye moved to a spatial location that was also target for hand movement, whereas during hand movement most cells fired depending on whether or not the animal had prior knowledge about the location of the visual targets.

Andersen,1996.0,"<jats:p> 1. In the companion paper we reported that the predominant signal of the population of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (area LIP) of the monkey's posterior parietal cortex (PPC) encode the next intended saccadic eye movement during the delay period of a memory-saccade task. This result predicts that, should be monkey change his intention of what the next saccade will be, LIP activity should change accordingly to reflect the new plan. We tested this prediction by training monkeys to change their saccadic plan on command and recording the activity of LIP neurons across plan changes. 2. We trained rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) to maintain fixation on a light spot as long as this spot remained on. During this period we briefly presented one, two, or three peripheral visual stimuli in sequence, each followed by a delay (memory period, M). After the final delay the fixation spot was extinguished, and the monkey had to quickly make a saccade to the location of the last target to have appeared. The monkey could not predict which stimuli, nor how many, would appear on each trial. He thus had to plan a saccade to each stimulus as it appeared and change his saccade plan whenever a stimulus appeared at a different location. 3. We recorded the M period activity of 81 area LIP neurons (from 3 hemispheres of 2 monkeys) in this task. We predicted that, if a neuron's activity reflected the monkey's planned saccade, its activity should be high while the monkey planned a saccade in the neuron's motor field (MF), and low while the planned saccade was in the opposite direction. The activity of most of the neurons in our sample changed in accordance with our hypothesis as the monkey's planned saccade changed. 4. In one condition the monkey was instructed by visual stimuli to change his plan from a saccade in the neuron's preferred direction to a saccade planned in the opposite direction. In this condition activity decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in 65 (80%) of 81 neurons tested. These neurons' activity changed to reflect the new saccade plan even though the cue for this change was not presented in their RF. 5. As a control we randomly interleaved, among trials requiring a plan change, trials in which the monkey had to formulate two consecutive plans to make a saccade in the neuron's preferred direction. The activity remained unchanged (P &lt; 0.05) in 22 of 31 neurons tested (79%), indicating that the neurons continued to encode the same saccade plan. 6. In a variant of the task, the cue to the location of the required saccade was either a light spot or a noise burst from a loudspeaker. Of 22 neurons tested in this task, 16 (73%) showed activity changes consistent with plan changes cued by visual or auditory stimuli. 7. Alterations in the monkey's intentions, even in the absence of overt behavior, are manifested in altered LIP activity. These activity changes could be induced whether visual or auditory cues were used to indicate the required plan changes. Most LIP neurons thus do not encode only the locations of visual stimuli, but also the intention to direct gaze to specific locations, independently of whether a gaze shift actually occurs. "

The center or focus of this expansion tells us our direction of self-motion, or heading, as long as our eyes are still. However, if our eyes move, as when tracking a nearby object on the ground, the retinal image is disrupted and the focus is shifted away from the heading. Neurons in primate dorso-medial superior temporal area responded selectively to an expansion focus in a certain part of the visual field, and this selective region shifted during tracking eye movements in a way that compensated for the retinal focus shift. Therefore, these neurons account for the effect of eye movements on what we see as we travel forward through the world."

Matching patterns of activity in primate prefrontal area 8a and parietal area 7ip neurons during a spatial working memory task. J. Neurophysiol. 79: 2919–2940, 1998. Single-unit recording studies of posterior parietal neurons have indicated a similarity of neuronal activation to that observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in relation to performance of delayed saccade tasks. A key issue addressed in the present study is whether the different classes of neuronal activity observed in these tasks are encountered more frequently in one or the other area or otherwise exhibit region-specific properties. The present study is the first to directly compare these patterns of neuronal activity by alternately recording from parietal area 7ip and prefrontal area 8a, under the identical behavioral conditions, within the same hemisphere of two monkeys performing an oculomotor delayed response task. The firing rate of 222 posterior parietal and 235 prefrontal neurons significantly changed during the cue, delay, and/or saccade periods of the task. Neuronal responses in the two areas could be distinguished only by subtle differences in their incidence and timing. Thus neurons responding to the cue appeared earliest and were more frequent among the task-related neurons within parietal cortex, whereas neurons exhibiting delay-period activity accounted for a larger proportion of task-related neurons in prefrontal cortex. Otherwise, the task-related neuronal activities were remarkably similar. Cue period activity in prefrontal and parietal cortex exhibited comparable spatial tuning and temporal duration characteristics, taking the form of phasic, tonic, or combined phasic/tonic excitation in both cortical populations. Neurons in both cortical areas exhibited sustained activity during the delay period with nearly identical spatial tuning. The various patterns of delay-period activity—tonic, increasing or decreasing, alone or in combination with greater activation during cue and/or saccade periods—likewise were distributed to both cortical areas. Finally, similarities in the two populations extended to the proportion and spatial tuning of presaccadic and postsaccadic neuronal activity occurring in relation to the memory-guided saccade. The present findings support and extend evidence for a faithful duplication of receptive field properties and virtually every other dimension of task-related activity observed when parietal and prefrontal cortex are recruited to a common task. This striking similarity attests to the principal that information shared by a prefrontal region and a sensory association area with which it is connected is domain specific and not subject to hierarchical elaboration, as is evident at earlier stages of visuospatial processing."

Less than 1% of the neurons were double‐labeled, thus suggesting that the two populations are largely separate. Two‐dimensional reconstructions of the distribution of labeled cells made on flattened reconstructions of the inferior parietal lobule revealed that the areal distribution of the two cortico‐cortical output arrays is complex. Although each pattern of labeling showed some discontinuities in density, there was no obvious periodicity within or between the spatial distributions of the two projecting populations. It was consistently observed that the cortex of the lateral wall of the intraparietal sulcus, adjacent to area 7a, projects more heavily to the prefrontal cortex than does area 7a itself."

A majority of the cells showed significant effects of eye position, for each of the 3 types of response. The direction tuning of the light- sensitive, memory and saccade responses did not change with eye position but the magnitude of the response did. Since previous work showed a similar effect for the light-sensitive response of area 7a neurons (Andersen and Mountcastle, 1983; Andersen et al., 1985b), the present results indicate that this modulating effect of eye position may be a general one, as it is found in 3 types of responses in 2 cortical areas. Gain fields were mapped by measuring the effect of eye position on the magnitude of the response at 9 different eye positions for each neuron. The gain fields were usually planar or largely planar for all 3 types of response in both areas, indicating that the magnitude of the response usually varies linearly with both horizontal and vertical eye position. A similar observation was made previously for the gain fields of the light-sensitive response of area 7a neurons (Andersen et al., 1985b). Although gain fields sloped in all directions for the population of cells, the gain field slopes of the light- sensitive, memory and saccade responses for individual cells were usually similar. It is proposed that these eye position effects play an important role in making coordinate transformations for visually guided movement."

These signals are combined using a specific gain mechanism that enables the different coordinate frames of the various input signals to be combined into common, distributed spatial representations. These distributed representations can be used to convert the sensory locations of stimuli into the appropriate motor coordinates required for making directed movements. Within these spatial representations of the posterior parietal cortex are neural activities related to higher cognitive functions, including attention. We review recent studies showing that the encoding of intentions to make movements is also among the cognitive functions of this area."

               <jats:p>My concern in this presentation is with the space of everyday action. The representation of this quotidian space in the brain is not one absolute space, but rather a patchwork of approximate spaces (partial representations) that link sensation to action. I mean ‘partial’ and ‘approximate’ in two senses: a representation will be partial because it represents only one small sample of space (that within reaching distance, that within sight, the features of an object relevant to grasping it, or more abstract ‘allocentric’ or cognitive representations), and it will be approximate in that it will be based on an incomplete sample of sensory date and may be of limited accuracy and reliability. I will suggest that our behaviour is mediated by the interaction of these partial representations: both through their integration to map ever larger portions of the territory relevant to behaviour, and through their mutual calibration to yield a shared representation more reliable than that obtainable by any one alone with its limited sample of sensory data."

To determine the relative distributions of cells projecting to the 2 pathways, we injected the posterior parietal and inferior temporal cortex with different fluorescent tracers in 5 rhesus monkeys. The parietal injections included the ventral intraparietal (VIP) and lateral intraparietal (LIP) areas, and the temporal injections included the lateral portions of cytoarchitectonic areas TE and TEO. There was a remarkable segregation of cells projecting to the 2 systems. Inputs to the parietal cortex tended to arise either from areas that have been implicated in spatial or motion analysis or from peripheral field representations in the prestriate cortex. By contrast, inputs to the temporal cortex tended to arise from areas that have been implicated in form and color analysis or from central field representations. Cells projecting to the parietal cortex were found in visual area 2 (V2), but only in the far peripheral representations of both the upper and lower visual field. Likewise, labeled cells found in visual areas 3 (V3) and 4 (V4) were densest in their peripheral representations. Heavy accumulations of labeled cells were found in the dorsal parieto-occipital cortex, including the parieto-occipital (PO) area, part A of V3 (V3A), and the dorsal prelunate area (DP). In the superior temporal sulcus, cells were found within several motion-sensitive areas, including the middle temporal area (MT), the medial superior temporal area (MST), the fundus of the superior temporal area (FST), and the superior temporal polysensory area (STP), as well as within anterior portions of the sulcus whose organization is as yet poorly defined. Cells projecting to areas TE and TEO in the temporal cortex were located within cytoarchitectonic area TG at the temporal pole and cytoarchitectonic areas TF and TH on the parahippocampal gyrus, as well as in noninjected portions of area TE buried within the superior temporal sulcus. In the prestriate cortex, labeled cells were found in V2, V3, and V4, but, in contrast to the loci labeled after parietal injections, those labeled after temporal injections were concentrated in the foveal or central field representations. Although few double-labeled cells were seen, 2 regions containing intermingled parietal- and temporal-projection cells were area V4 and the cortex at the bottom of the anterior superior temporal sulcus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Gnadt; R. A. Andersen,1991.0,"<jats:p> 1. The cortex of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) contains neurons whose activity is related to saccadic eye movements. The exact role of the IPL in relation to saccades remains, however, unclear. In this and the companion paper, we approach this problem by quantifying many of the spatial and temporal parameters of the saccade-related (S) activity. These parameters have hitherto been largely unstudied. 2. The activity of single neurons was recorded from Macaca mulatta monkeys while they were performing a delayed-saccade task. The analysis presented here is based on 161 neurons recorded from the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), a recently defined subdivision of the IPL; and 54 neurons recorded from the neighboring part of the IPL, area 7a. Overall, 409 IPL neurons were isolated in this study. 3. The typical activity of IPL neurons during the delayed-saccade task has three basic phases: light sensitive (LS), memory (M), and S. These basic phases are common to neurons of both areas LIP and 7a. In each phase (LS, M, and S), individual neurons may or may not be active. Most LIP neurons, however, are active in more than one phase. 4. To compare the activity levels of different neurons, the actual firing rate was weighted by each neuron's background level, yielding an ""activity index"" for each neuron, in each phase of the task. We calculated the activity index for the LS and M phases and for three phases related to the saccade: a presaccadic (Pre-S), a saccade-coincident (S-Co), and a postsaccadic (Post-S) phase. For area LIP neurons the median values of the activity index were high for the LS, M, Pre-S, and S-Co activities, and slightly lower in the Post-S period. In area 7a the median values were low for the LS phase and, in particular, for the M and Pre-S phases, somewhat higher coincident with the saccade, and high post-saccadically. 5. In area LIP, in each phase, 49-63% of the neurons had excitatory activity, and 10-17% had inhibitory responses. 6. In contrast, in area 7a excitatory responses were most frequent in the Post-S phase (56%). Excitation was particularly infrequent during M (28%) and Pre-S (22%). The incidence of inhibitory responses varied too (4-18%). The time course of inhibition was roughly opposite that of excitation; the highest frequency of inhibitory responses occurred during the saccade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

Andersen,1991.0,"<jats:p> 1. Single-neuron activity was recorded from the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) of Macaca mulatta monkeys while they were performing delayed saccades and related tasks. Temporal characteristics of this activity were presented in the companion paper. Here we focus on the spatial characteristics of the activity. The analysis was based on recordings from 145 neurons. All these neurons were from the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), a recently defined subdivision of the IPL. 2. Delayed saccades were made in eight directions. Direction-tuning curves were calculated for each neuron, during each of the following activity phases that were described in the companion paper: light sensitive (LS), delay-period memory (M), and saccade related (S); the latter further partitioned into presaccadic (Pre-S), saccade coincident (S-Co), and postsaccadic (Post-S). 3. Width and preferred direction were calculated for each direction-tuning curve. We studied the distributions of widths and preferred directions in LIP's neuronal population. In each case we included only neurons that showed clear excitatory activity in the phases in question. 4. Width was defined as the angle over which the response was higher than 50% of its maximal net value. Width distributions were similar for all phases studied. Widths varied widely from neuron to neuron, from very narrow (less than 45 degrees) to very wide (close to 360 degrees). Median widths were approximately 90 degrees in all phases. 5. Preferred-direction distributions were also similar for various phases. All directions were represented in each distribution, but contralateral directions were more frequent (e.g., 69% for S-Co). 6. For each neuron the alignment of the preferred directions of its various phases was determined. Distributions of alignments were calculated (again, phases that were not clearly excitatory were disregarded). On the level of the neuronal population LS, M, and Pre-S were well aligned with each other. S-Co was also aligned with these phases, but less precisely. 7. A set of ""narrowly tuned"" neurons was selected by imposing a constraint of narrow (width, less than 90 degrees) LS and S-Co direction tuning. In this set of neurons, the LS and S-Co preferred directions were very well aligned (median, 12 degrees). The fraction of narrowly tuned neurons in the population was 40% (25/63). Thus, in a large subpopulation of area LIP, a fairly precise alignment exists between sensory and motor fields. 8. An additional set of 82 area LIP neurons were recorded while the monkey performed delayed saccades to 32 targets located on small, medium, and large imaginary circles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

This study investigated whether the neuronal activity of a cortical area devoted to the control of limb movements is affected by variations in eye position within the orbit. Two rhesus monkeys were trained to perform a conditional visuomotor task with an instructed delay period while maintaining gaze on a fixation point. 2. The experimental design required each monkey to put its hand on a metal touch pad located at arm's length and fixate a small spot of light presented on a computer screen. Then a visual cue came on, at the fixation point or elsewhere, the color of which instructed the monkey to move its limb to one of two touch pads according to a conditional rule. A red cue meant a movement to the left, whereas a green one instructed a movement to the right. The cue lasted for a variable delay period (1-3 s), and the monkey had to wait for its offset, the go signal, before performing the correct response. The fixation point and the cues were presented at various screen locations in a combination that allowed examination of whether eye position and/or target position modulate the neuronal activity. Because the monkeys' heads were fixed, all changes in eye position reflected movements in a craniocentric, head-centered, coordinate space. 3. The activity of single neurons was recorded from dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). For most neurons (79%), the activity during the instructed delay period (set-related activity) reflects the direction of the upcoming limb movement but varies significantly with eye position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "

Goldberg,1985.0,"<jats:p> We studied the activity of single neurons in the frontal eye fields of awake macaque monkeys trained to perform several oculomotor tasks. Fifty-four percent of neurons discharged before visually guided saccades. Three different types of presaccadic activity were observed: visual, movement, and anticipatory. Visual activity occurred in response to visual stimuli whether or not the monkey made saccades. Movement activity preceded purposive saccades, even those made without visual targets. Anticipatory activity preceded even the cue to make a saccade if the monkey could reliably predict what saccade he had to make. These three different activities were found in different presaccadic cells in different proportions. Forty percent of presaccadic cells had visual activity (visual cells) but no movement activity. For about half of the visual cells the response was enhanced if the monkey made saccades to the receptive-field stimulus, but there was no discharge before similar saccades made without visual targets. Twenty percent of presaccadic neurons discharged as briskly before purposive saccades made without a visual target as they did before visually guided saccades, and had weak or absent visual responses. These cells were defined as movement cells. Movement cells discharged much less or not at all before saccades made spontaneously without a task requirement or an overt visual target. The remaining presaccadic neurons (40%) had both visual and movement activity (visuomovement cells). They discharged most briskly before visually guided eye movements, but also discharged before purposive eye movements made in darkness and responded to visual stimuli in the absence of saccades. There was a continuum of visuomovement cells, from cells in which visual activity predominated to cells in which movement activity predominated. This continuum suggests that although visual cells are quite distinct from movement cells, the division of cell types into three classes may be only a heuristic means of describing the processing flow from visual input to eye-movement output. Twenty percent of visuomovement and movement cells, but fewer than 2% of visual cells, had anticipatory activity. Only one cell had anticipatory activity as its sole response. When the saccade was delayed relative to the target onset, visual cells responded to the target appearance, movement cells discharged before the saccade, and visuomovement cells discharged in different ways during the delay, usually with some discharge following the target and an increase in rate immediately before the saccade. Presaccadic neurons of all types were actively suppressed following a saccade into their response fields.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

As we scan an image, saccadic eye movements direct our vision to features that attract our attention. Although it is likely that the frontal eye field (FEF) cortex is an important component of the system generating those movements, most studies of FEF neuronal activity have relied upon visuomotor tasks where the experimental subjects are constrained to look from one spot of light to another. In this study, single-unit activity was recorded in the FEF while monkeys freely scanned a variety of projected images, and that activity was compared with activity evoked during conventional visuomotor tasks. 2. FEF neurons with visual activity in conventional tasks increased their activity during scanning when a portion of the image within their receptive field was targeted for the next saccade, but decreased their activity when a target was chosen outside of the receptive field. 3. FEF neurons with movement-related activity during conventional tasks were also active in association with saccades made during scanning. 4. Visual and movement activity were also studied by creating a task that approximated the conditions during the scanning paradigm (rescan task). This was done by superimposing a moveable spot of light onto the image that had been scanned, and rewarding the monkey for following the light as it recreated the original scan's spatial and temporal pattern of eye fixations. In contrast to the visual activity of neurons during the scanning paradigm, visual activity during the rescan task was unaffected by portions of the image within the cell's receptive field, but increased in response to the appearance of the target light.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) "

The middle temporal area (MT) projects to the intraparietal sulcus in the macaque monkey. We describe here a discrete area in the depths of the intraparietal sulcus containing neurons with response properties similar to those reported for area MT. We call this area the physiologically defined ventral intraparietal area, or VIP. In the present study we recorded from single neurons in VIP of alert monkeys and studied their visual and oculomotor response properties. 2. Area VIP has a high degree of selectivity for the direction of a moving stimulus. In our sample 72/88 (80%) neurons responded at least twice as well to a stimulus moving in the preferred direction compared with a stimulus moving in the null direction. The average response to stimuli moving in the preferred direction was 9.5 times as strong as the response to stimuli moving in the opposite direction, as compared with 10.9 times as strong for neurons in area MT. 3. Many neurons were also selective for speed of stimulus motion. Quantitative data from 25 neurons indicated that the distribution of preferred speeds ranged from 10 to 320 degrees/s. The degree of speed tuning was on average twice as broad as that reported for area MT. 4. Some neurons (22/41) were selective for the distance at which a stimulus was presented, preferring a stimulus of equivalent visual angle and luminance presented near (within 20 cm) or very near (within 5 cm) the face. These neurons maintained their preference for near stimuli when tested monocularly, suggesting that visual cues other than disparity can support this response. These neurons typically could not be driven by small spots presented on the tangent screen (at 57 cm). 5. Some VIP neurons responded best to a stimulus moving toward the animal. The absolute direction of visual motion was not as important for these cells as the trajectory of the stimulus: the best stimulus was one moving toward a particular point on the face from any direction. 6. VIP neurons were not active in relation to saccadic eye movements. Some neurons (10/17) were active during smooth pursuit of a small target. 7. The predominance of direction and speed selectivity in area VIP suggests that it, like other visual areas in the dorsal stream, may be involved in the analysis of visual motion. "

Goldberg,1996.0,"<jats:p> 1. Posterior parietal cortex contains neurons that are visually responsive and active in relation to saccadic eye movements. We recorded from single neurons in a subregion of parietal cortex, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), in alert rhesus monkeys. To characterize more completely the circumstances under which LIP neurons are responsive, we used five tasks designed to test the impact of sensory, motor, and cognitive factors. We obtained quantitative data in multiple tasks in 91 neurons. We measured neural activity during central fixation and in relation to stimulus onset and saccade onset. 2. LIP neurons have visual responses to the onset of a stationary stimulus in the receptive field. These visual responses occurred both in tasks that require a subsequent eye movement toward the stimulus and in tasks in which eye movements are not permitted, indicating that this activity is sensory rather than presaccadic. 3. Visual responses were enhanced when the monkey had to use information provided by the stimulus to guide its behavior. The amplitude of the sensory response to a given stimulus was increased in a task in which the monkey would subsequently make a saccade to the location signaled by the stimulus, as compared with the amplitude of the visual response in a simple fixation task. 4. The visual response was also enhanced when the monkey attended to the stimulus without looking at it. This result shows that enhancement does not reflect saccade preparation because the response is enhanced even when the monkey is not permitted to make a saccade. Instead, enhancement reflects the allocation of attention to the spatial locus of the receptive field. 5. Many LIP neurons had saccade-related activity in addition to their visual responses. The visual response for most neurons was stronger than the saccade-related activation. 6. Saccade-related activity was independent of visual activity. Similar presaccadic activity was observed in trials that included a recent visual stimulus (memory-guided saccade task) and in trials with no visual stimulus (learned saccade task). 7. We observed increases in activity during fixation in tasks in which the monkey could anticipate the onset of a behaviorally significant stimulus. LIP neurons usually showed low levels of background firing in the fixation task during the period before stimulus onset. This background activity was increased in the peripheral attention and memory-guided saccade tasks during the period when the monkey was waiting for a behaviorally relevant stimulus to appear. 8. The results from these several tasks indicate that LIP neurons are activated in a variety of circumstances and are not involved exclusively in sensory processing or motor planning. The modulation of sensory responses by attention and anticipation suggests that cognitive factors play a major role in parietal function. "

Distinguishable retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into area PO at separate retinotopic loci identified by single‐neuron recording.<jats:p>The results indicate that area PO receives retinotopically organized inputs from visual areas V1, V2, V3, V4, and MT. In each of these areas the projection to PO arises from the representation of the periphery of the visual field. This finding is consistent with neurophysiological data indicating that the representation of the periphery is emphasized in PO. Additional projections arise from area MST, the frontal eye fields, and several divisions of parietal cortex, including four zones within the intraparietal sulcus and a region on the medial dorsal surface of the hemisphere (MDP).<jats:p>On the basis of the laminar distribution of labeled cells we conclude that area PO receives an ascending input from V1, V2, and V3 and receives descending or lateral inputs from all other areas. Thus, area PO is at approximately the same level in the hierarchy of visual areas as areas V4 and MT.<jats:p>Area PO is connected both directly and indirectly, via MT and MST, to parietal cortex. Within parietal cortex, area PO is linked to particular regions of the intraparietal sulcus including VIP and LIP and two newly recognized zones termed here MIP and PIP. The wealth of connections with parietal cortex suggests that area PO provides a relatively direct route over which information concerning the visual field periphery can be transmitted from striate and prestriate cortex to parietal cortex. In contrast, area PO has few links with areas projecting to inferior temporal cortex. The pattern of connections revealed in this study is consistent with the view that area PO is primarily involved in visuospatial functioning."

Here we investigated the relationship between neural response and perception by recording from IT neurons in monkeys while they viewed realistic images. We then compared the similarity of neural responses elicited by images to the quantitative similarity of the images. Image similarity was approximated using several algorithms, two of which were designed to search image databases for perceptually similar images. Some algorithms for image similarity correlated well with human perception, and these algorithms explained part of the stimulus selectivity of IT neurons. Images that elicited similar neural responses were ranked as more similar by these algorithms than images that elicited different neural responses, and images ranked as similar by the algorithms elicited similar responses from neurons. Neural selectivity was predicted more accurately when the reference images for algorithm similarity elicited either very strong or very weak responses from the neuron. The degree to which algorithms for image similarity were correlated with human perception was related to the degree to which algorithms explained the selectivity of IT neurons, providing support for the proposal that the selectivity of IT neurons is related to perceptual similarity of images."

Siegel,1990.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The anatomical and functional organization of the inferior parietal lobule was investigated in macaque monkeys by using anterograde and retrograde anatomical tracing techniques and single cell recording techniques in awake, behaving monkeys. The connections of areas 7a and 7b, and of two previously unexplored areas, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the dorsal prelunate area (DP), were examined in detail. Functional mapping experiments were performed in all four areas.<jats:p>Prior to this study the pathways for visual input to area 7a were unclear. In these experiments we found several direct projections from extrastriate visual areas, including the lateral intraparietal (LIP), dorsal prelunate (DP), parieto‐occipital (PO), and medial superior temporal (MST) areas into area 7a. Using the observed laminar patterns of connections between areas 7a, LIP, and DP and other extrastriate cortical areas, we were able to construct a hypothetical flow of visual information processing from striate cortex to area 7a. A broader hierarchy was also produced, which relates the positions of areas 7a, 7b, LIP, and DP to various cortical fields in the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes.<jats:p>By combining single cell recording techniques in trained monkeys with anatomical tracing techniques, we have parcelled the inferior parietal lobule into several subdivisions on the basis of both anatomical and physiological grounds. A clear segregation of visual and somatosensory responses was found in the inferior parietal lobule with areas 7a, LIP, and DP being visual and visual‐motor and area 7b being primarily somatosensory. A similar segregation was found anatomically with areas 7a LIP, and DP being interconnected primarily with other visual cortical areas and area 7b being connected with several somatosensory areas. Area 7b was also found to connect to a few visual cortical areas, and these connections likely account for the small but consistent number of visually responsive cells that are found in this region. Areas LIP, DP, and 7a differed in receptive field and saccade‐related properties. Area 7a visual receptive fields were very large and usually bilateral with a small but significant number of them having receptive field centers in the ipsilateral visual field. Area DP and LIP receptive fields were smaller and the receptive field peaks were almost always confined to the contralateral visual field. Areas 7a, DP, and LIP all contained cells with saccade‐related responses; however, in area 7a there were fewer saccade cells than area LIP, and presaccadic responses were only observed in area LIP. Consistent with its functional specialization for saccades, area LIP was found to be strongly interconnected with areas involved in saccadic eye movements, including the frontal eye fields and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, whereas area 7a had only weak connections to the frontal eye fields and had no detectable projection to the superior colliculus. Areas LIP, 7a, and DP neurons were found to have eye‐position‐related activity. Extensive quantitative experiments showed the distributions of the slopes and directions of the gaze fields were similar in areas 7a and LIP, but the intercepts were larger for area LIP.<jats:p>Area 7a was found to be connected to at least 22 cortical areas, including MST, superior temporal polysensory (STP), fundus superior temporal (FST), inferotemporal (IT), lateral and medial T F (TF1, TFm) areas, and TEO in the temporal lobe; LIP, DP, PO, medial intraparietal (MIP), posterior intraparietal (PIP), medial dorsal parietal (MDP), medial PG (PGm), and 7b areas in the parieto‐occipital cortex; areas Ba, 46,45,11, and supplementary eye fields (SEF) in the frontal lobe; and areas LC and LA in the cingulate gyrus. Area 7b was found to be connected to area 5; the granular insula (IG), PGm, LC, LA, MDP, MST, PO, STP, and IT areas, and areas 45, 6, and 12. Area LIP had corticocortical connections with the PO, DP, 7a, MST, middle temporal (MT), V4, dorsal and ventral V3 (V3d, V ∼ V ), V3A, TEO, TF, 8a, and 46 areas. Area DP was connected to V3A, LIP, 7a, V4, MST, PO, 46, and 8a. All corticocortical connections were reciprocal.<jats:p>The view that emerges from this study is of a densely interconnected network of connections between large numbers of brain regions with each cortical area, including areas 7a, 7b, LIP, and DP, being a single node in this highly distributed and interactive network. An important goal is to determine what different computations are being performed at each node in this network."

Cowan,1985.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The thalamic relations of the caudal inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in monkeys have been investigated with both anterograd and retrograde neuroanatomical tracing techniques.<jats:p>The results of these experiments indicate that the medial pulvinar nucleus (Pul.m.) is the principal thalamic relay to the gyral surface of the caudal inferior parietal lobule (area 7a). Within the Pul.m. there are two or three disklike aggregates of neurons which project to area 7a; these disklike neuronal aggregates are oriented from dorsomedial to ventrolateral and extend over most of the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus. Within these disks there are rodlike clusters of neurons which are elongated in the rostrocaudal dimension of the thalamus, and which project in a topographically ordered manner to area 7a. Thus, the more rostrally located neurons within the Pul.m. disks project to more rostral parts of area 7a and, conversely, the more caudally located neurons project to the caudal part of this cortical field. Similarly, the medial part of each disk projects to the lateral part of area 7a while the laterally placed neurons project to the medial part of the cortical field. In addition to its input from the Pul.m., area 7a is also reciprocally connected with the magnocellular division of the nucleus ventralis anterior, with the nuclei which abut upon the medullary capsule of the laterodorsal nucleus, and with the suprageniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans.<jats:p>The cortex on the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (the so‐called lateral intraparietal area, LIP) projects principally to the lateral pulvinar nucleus (Pul.1) of the thalamus rather than to Pul.m. Area LIP has been found to project to the pregeniculate nucleus, the zona incdrta, the anterior pretectal nucleus, and the superior colliculus. Area 7a projects to none of these structures, but it does project to the posterior pretectal nucleus. The thalamic relations of the neighboring cortical regions, such as the prelunate gyrus and area 7b, are also distinct from those of area 7a. It thus seems that the prelunate gyrus is primarily interconnected with the Pul.l., and area 7b with the oral pulvinar nucleus. Taken together these different subcortical relationships provide further evidence for the view that the caudal inferior parietal lobule is not a homogeneous cortical area, but is composed of a number of subsidiary fields.<jats:p>The projection from the Pul.m. to the lateral prefrontal cortex arises from disklike aggregates of neurons, similar in their orientation to the neuronal disks that project to. area 7a. These two populations of Pul.m. neurons occupy partially overlapping zones so that after large dye injections into both the parietal and frontal lobes there are label‐free spaces between the sidklike neuronal aggregates. However, although they overlap, it is evident from double labeling experiments with distinct retrogradely transportedflourescent dyes that the two populations of cortically projecting neurons are essentially separate."

Wurtz,1998.0,"<jats:p>Complex visual scenes require that a target for an impending saccadic eye movement be selected from a larger number of possible targets. We investigated whether changing the probability that a visual stimulus would be selected as the target for a saccade altered activity of monkey superior colliculus (SC) neurons in two experiments. First, we changed the number of possible targets on each trial. Second, we kept the visual display constant and presented a single saccade target repeatedly so that target probability was established over time. Buildup neurons in the SC, those with delay period activity, showed a consistent reduction in activity as the probability of the saccade decreased, independent of the visual stimulus configuration. Other SC neurons, fixation and burst, were largely unaffected by the changes in saccade target probability. Because we had monkeys making saccades to many locations within the visual field, we could examine activity associated with saccades outside of the movement field of neurons. We found the activity of buildup neurons to be similar across the SC, before the target was identified, and reduced when the number of possible targets increased. The results of our experiments are consistent with a role for this activity in establishing a motor set. We found, consistent with this interpretation, that the activity of these neurons was predictive of the latency of a saccadic eye movement and not other saccade parameters such as end point or peak velocity."

Goldberg,2004.0,"<jats:p>The activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the monkey predicts the monkey's allocation of spatial attention. We show here that despite being relatively high within the visual hierarchy, neurons in LIP have extremely short and precise visual latencies. Mean latency was 45.2 msec; the timing precision of the onset response was usually better than 4 msec. The majority of neurons had a pause in response after an initial burst, followed by more sustained visual activity. Previous attention allocation had no effect on either the latency or magnitude of the initial burst, but produced clear effects on the magnitude of the later sustained activity. Together, these data indicate that the initial burst in LIP visual response reflects an uncontaminated sensory signal. Information about stimulus onset is transmitted rapidly through the visual system to LIP; the on-response has a higher speed and temporal precision than realized previously. This information could be used to orient attention to novel objects in the visual environment rapidly and reliably."

Stoner,1990.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The visual receptive field physiology and anatomical connections of the lateral intraparietal area (area LIP), a visuomotor area in the lateral bank of the inferior parietal lobule, were investigated in the cynomolgus monkey (<jats:italic>Macaca fascicularis</jats:italic>). Afferent input and physiological properties of area 5 neurons in the medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus (i.e., area PEa) were also determined. Area LIP is composed of two myeloarchitectonic zones: a ventral zone (LIPv), which is densely myelinated, and a lightly myelinated dorsal zone (LIPd) adjacent to visual area 7a. Previous single‐unit recording studies in our laboratory have characterized visuomotor properties of area LIP neurons, including many neurons with powerful saccade‐related activity. In the first part of the present study, single‐unit recordings were used to map visual receptive fields from neurons in the two myeloarchitectonic zones of LIP. Receptive field size and eccentricity were compared to those in adjacent area 7a. The second part of the study investigated the cortico‐cortical connections of area LIP neurons using tritiated amino acid injections and fluorescent retrograde tracers placed directly into different rostrocaudal and dorsoventral parts of area LIP. The approach to area LIP was through somatosensory area 5, which eliminated the possibility of diffusion of tracers into area 7a.<jats:p>Unlike many area 7a receptive fields, which are large and bilateral, area LIP receptive fields were much smaller and exclusively confined to the contralateral visual field. In area LIP, an orderly progression in visual receptive fields was evident as the recording electrode moved tangentially to the cortical surface and through the depths of area LIP. The overall visual receptive field organization, however, yielded only a rough topography with some duplications in receptive field representation within a given rostrocaudal or dorsoventral part of LIP. The central visual field representation was generally located more dorsally and the peripheral visual field more ventrally within the sulcus. The lower visual field was represented more anteriorly and the upper visual field more posteriorly. In LIP, receptive field size increased with eccentricity but with much variability within the sample.<jats:p>Area LIPv was found to have reciprocal cortico‐cortical connections with many extrastriate visual areas, including the parieto‐occipital visual area PO; areas V3, V3A, and V4; the middle temporal area (MT); the middle superior temporal area (MST); dorsal prelunate area (DP); and area TEO (the occipital division of the intratemporal cortex). Area LIPv is also connected to area TF in the lateral posterior parahippocampal gyrus. Although area LIPd has many of the same cortico‐cortical connections as LIPv, some differences were apparent. Area LIPd and not LIPv has connections with visual areas TEa and TEm (anterior and medial divisions of the intratemporal cortex) and with multimodal area IPa (subdivision of association cortex in caudal bank of superior temporal cortex) in the superior temporal sulcus. A topographic relationship between rostrocaudal parts of area LIP (including both LIPv and LIPd) and the lateromedial parts of prefrontal cortex across areas 8a (frontal eye fields) and the medial portion of area 46 was also apparent. Intrinsic connections of LIP with other areas in the inferior parietal lobule included a feedforward projection to area 7a and connections with the bimodal ventral intraparietal area (VIP) as well as with somatosensory area 7b (PF). Some retrogradely labeled cells were seen in area 5, but this projection was not confirmed by control injections placed in the medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus (area PEa). An interesting observation was that the input into areas PEa and LIP from parieto‐occipital visual areas (medial dorsal parietal area (blDPl and area PO) was found to be topographically organized such that MDP and the dorsal part of PO project to area PEa, while ventral PO and a few MDP neurons project to the opposite bank in LIP. This “visual” input to area PEa was also seen in single‐unit recordings in area 5 in wlhich a small number of visually responsive cells were identified Le., 7 of 204 neurons). All remaining neurons mapped in area 5 were highly responsive to joint position, movement, and/or touch.<jats:p>These anatomical and physiological data demonstrate that area LIP is a unique visual area in posterior parietal cortex, with histological, anatomical, and physiological properties different from other areas in the inferior parietal lobule.

Seventy‐five percent of the cells showed statistically significant responses to one or more of these optic flow stimuli. Shifting the location of the singularity of the optic flow stimuli within the visual field led to a response modulation in almost all cases. For the majority of neurons, this modulatory influence could be approximated in a statistically significant manner by a two‐dimensional linear regression. Gradient directions, derived from the regression parameters and indicating the direction of the steepest increase in the responses, were uniformly distributed. At the population level, an unbiased average response for the stimuli with different focus locations was observed. By applying a population code, termed ‘isofrequency encoding’, we demonstrate the capability of the recorded neuronal ensemble to retrieve the focus location from its population discharge. Responses to expansion and contraction stimuli cannot be predicted based on quantitative data on a neuron's frontoparallel preferred stimulus direction and the location and size of its receptive field.

Thereby, we have identified for the first time the presence of vestibular sensory input to this area and described its interaction with somatosensory and visual signals, via extracellular single‐cell recordings in awake head‐fixed animals. Visual responses were driven by large field stimuli that simulated either backward or forward self‐motion (contraction or expansion stimuli, respectively), or movement in the frontoparallel plane (visual increments moving simultaneously in the same direction). While the dominant sensory modality in most neurons was visual, about one third of all recorded neurons responded to horizontal rotation. These vestibular responses were typically in phase with head velocity, but in some cases they could signal acceleration or even showed integration to position. The associated visual responses were always codirectional with the vestibular on‐direction, i.e. noncomplementary. Somatosensory responses were in register with the visual preferred direction, either in the same or in the opposite direction, thus signalling translation or rotation in the horizontal plane. These results, taken together with data on responses to optic flow stimuli obtained in a parallel study, strongly suggest an involvement of area VIP in the analysis and the encoding of self‐motion."

These could be subdivided into neurones which responded to movement in any direction within the receptive field and neurones which responded to movement in one direction only (directionally selective neurones). Another type of cell was responsive to both contour and movement, much like the complex and lower order hypercomplex cells. Almost all such neurones were directionally selective.<jats:p>4. In oblique penetrations through this cortical region, there tended frequently to be an orderly shift in preferred directions of motion, thus suggesting the possibility of a columnar organization for movement.<jats:p>5.

F. Baker; S. E. Petersen; W. T. Newsome; J. M. Allman,1981.0,"<jats:p> 1. The response properties of 354 single neurons in the medial (M), dorsomedial (DM), dorsolateral (DL), and middle temporal (MT) visual areas were studied quantitatively with bar, spot, and random-dot stimuli in chronically implanted owl monkeys with fixed gaze. 2. A directionality index was computed to compare the responses to stimuli in the optimal direction with the responses to the opposing direction of movement. The greater the difference between opposing directions, the higher the index. MT cells had much higher direction indices to moving bars than cells in DL, DM, and M. 3. A tuning index was computed for each cell to compare the responses to bars moving in the optimal direction, or flashed in the optimal orientation, with the responses in other directions or orientations within +/- 90 degrees. Cells in all four areas were more sharply tuned to the orientation of stationary flashed bars than to moving bars, although a few cells (9/92( were unresponsive in the absence of movement. DM cells tended to be more sharply tuned to moving bars than cells in the other areas. 4. Directionality in DM, DL, and MT was relatively unaffected by the use of single-spot stimuli instead of bars; tuning in all four areas was broader to spots than bars. 5. Moving arrays of randomly spaced spots were more strongly excitatory than bar stimuli for many neurons in MT (16/31 cells). These random-dot stimuli were also effective in M, but evoked no response or weak responses from most cells in DM and DL. 6. The best velocities of movement were usually in the range of 10-100 degrees/s, although a few cells (22/227), primarily in MT (14/69 cells), preferred higher velocities. 7. Receptive fields of neurons in all four areas were much larger than striate receptive fields. Eccentricity was positively correlated with receptive-field size (r = 0.62), but was not correlated with directionality index, tuning index, or best velocity. 8. The results support the hypothesis that there are specializations of function among the cortical visual areas. "

Albright,1984.0,"<jats:p> We recorded from single neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of the macaque monkey and studied their direction and orientation selectivity. We also recorded from single striate cortex (V1) neurons in order to make direct comparisons with our observations in area MT. All animals were immobilized and anesthetized with nitrous oxide. Direction selectivity of 110 MT neurons was studied with three types of moving stimuli: slits, single spots, and random-dot fields. All of the MT neurons were found to be directionally selective using one or more of these stimuli. MT neurons exhibited a broad range of direction-tuning bandwidths to all stimuli (minimum = 32 degrees, maximum = 186 degrees, mean = 95 degrees). On average, responses were strongly unidirectional and of similar magnitude for all three stimulus types. Orientation selectivity of 89 MT neurons was studied with stationary flashed slits. Eighty-three percent were found to be orientation selective. Overall, orientation-tuning bandwidths were significantly narrower (mean = 64 degrees) than direction-tuning bandwidths for moving stimuli. Moreover, responses to stationary-oriented stimuli were generally smaller than those to moving stimuli. Direction selectivity of 55 V1 neurons was studied with moving slits; orientation selectivity of 52 V1 neurons was studied with stationary flashed slits. In V1, compared with MT, direction-tuning bandwidths were narrower (mean = 68 degrees). Moreover, V1 responses to moving stimuli were weaker, and bidirectional tuning was more common. The mean orientation-tuning bandwidth in V1 was also significantly narrower than that in MT (mean = 52 degrees), but the responses to stationary-oriented stimuli were of similar magnitude in the two areas. We examined the relationship between optimal direction and optimal orientation for MT neurons and found that 61% had an orientation preference nearly perpendicular to the preferred direction of motion, as is the case for all V1 neurons. However, another 29% of MT neurons had an orientation preference roughly parallel to the preferred direction. These observations, when considered together with recent reports claiming sensitivity of some MT neurons to moving visual patterns (39), suggest specific neural mechanisms underlying pattern-motion sensitivity in area MT. These results support the notion that area MT represents a further specialization over area V1 for stimulus motion processing. Furthermore, the marked similarities between direction and orientation tuning in area MT in macaque and owl monkey support the suggestion that these areas are homologues. "

Gross,1984.0,"<jats:p> We recorded from single neurons in visual area MT of the macaque in order to examine the spatial distribution of its directionally selective cells. The animals were paralyzed and anesthetized with nitrous oxide. All MT neurons (n = 614) responded better to moving stimuli than to stationary stimuli. For 55% of the neurons, responses to moving stimuli were independent of stimulus color, shape, length, or orientation. For the remaining cells, stimulus length affected the response magnitude and tuning bandwidth but not the preferred direction. MT neurons were divided into four categories on the basis of their sensitivity to moving stimuli: 60% responded exclusively to one direction of motion, 24% responded best to one direction with a weaker response in the opposite direction, 8% responded equally well to two opposite directions of motion, and 8% responded equally well to all directions of motion. The direction preferences of successively sampled cells on a penetration either changed by small increments or occasionally by approximately 180 degrees. Thus, there is a systematic representation of direction of motion. The representation of axis of motion, i.e., the orientation of the path along which a stimulus moves, is more continuous than the representation of direction of motion. There was a systematic relationship between penetration angle and rate of change of preferred axis of motion, indicating that cells with a similar axis of motion preference are arranged in vertical columns. Furthermore, axis of motion columns appear to exist in the form of continuous slabs in area MT. The size of these slabs is such that 180 degrees of axis of motion are represented in 400-500 micron of cortex. There was also a systematic relationship between penetration angle and frequency of 180 degrees reversals, indicating that cells with a similar direction of motion preference are also organized in vertical columns and cells with opposite direction preferences are located in adjacent columns within a single axis of motion column. Just as in macaque striate cortex where approximately 500 micron of cortex contain the mechanism for the local analysis of stimulus orientation, so in MT approximately 500 micron of cortex contain the mechanism for the local analysis of stimulus motion.

Direct and indirect effects of intracortical stimulattion on pyramidal tract cells were compared in the monkey and in the cat under barbiturate or chloralose anaesthesia. The hind‐limb motor areas were explored, that in the monkey only within the convex part of the precentral gyrus. The intracortical stimuli were applied in the nearest vicinity of pyramidal tract cells, where antidromic spike potentials of single cells were recorded. 2. Average records of descending volleys in corticospinal tract fibres were taken from the surface of the lateral funiculus or from its dissected fascicles. The sensitivity of the recording was sufficient to detect responses in single fibres. 3. The latencies of the earliest descending volleys evoked by weak intracortical stimuli were compared with the latencies of the antidromic spike potentials of pyramidal tract cells evoked by stimulation of the lateral funiculus at a low lumbar level (same conduction distance). Only in about one third of cases these latencies were similar and compatible with a direct activation of pyramidal tract cells. In the remaining cases they indicated mono‐ or polysynaptic activation of pyramidal tract cells. 4. Latencies of the later components of the descending volleys indicated that they were due to indirect activation of pyramidal tract cells in practically all cases. 5. The components of the descending volleys attributable to the indirect activation of pyramidal tract cells were greatly increased when repetitive intracortical stimuli were applied instead of single ones. 6. The investigation leads to the conclusion that a weak intracortical stimulation is relatively ineffective in a direct excitation of pyramidal tract cells and that the effects of such a stimulation are mainly indirect, especially when repetitive stimuli are used."

We studied the functional organization of color opponency in the blob regions of the parafoveal representation of the visual cortex. We also examined the patterns of connectivity among blob and nonblob cells by multiple electrode penetrations and cross-correlation analysis. Some of the color- selective cells in the blobs exhibited receptive fields that were similar to those found in the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN): one type exhibited center-surround spatial and chromatic opponency corresponding to the Type I cell found in the LGN; another had center-only chromatic opponency, corresponding to the Type II cell of the LGN. A blob color-selective cell with no LGN counterpart had center color opponency with a nonchromatically opponent surround antagonism. We termed this cell the “modified Type II” cell. Contrary to previous reports, few true double color-opponent cells were found. Some blob cells previously characterized as double opponent probably belong to our modified Type II category and, unlike true double opponent cells, do not respond well to isoluminant color boundaries. Occasional color-selective oriented cells were either intermixed or in close proximity to blob cells. Neighboring electrode penetrations within the same blob yielded cells of the same color opponency, either red versus green or blue versus yellow, suggesting that individual blobs are dedicated to processing one color opponency. Blobs dedicated to red/green color opponency were 3 times more numerous than blue/yellow blobs. Furthermore, the cells in layer 4C lying beneath blobs of a given color opponency had identical color opponency to the overlying cells in blobs. Cross-correlation analysis of pairs of nonblob, oriented cells in the superficial layers showed interactions between cells with matched orientation and eye preference, at varying horizontal separations. Such interactions are consistent with anatomically demonstrated clustered horizontal connections. Positive cross-correlograms were found between blob cells in the same and in adjacent blobs when the cells' receptive field type, color opponency, and ocular dominance matched. Correlograms also indicated monosynaptic connections from Type II to modified Type II cells of the same color opponency, suggesting that Type II cells may contribute to the construction of the modified Type II fields in the cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This is seen for both intrinsic cortical connections within a particular cortical area and the convergent and divergent connections running between area 17 and other cortical areas. To determine if these connections are related to the columnar functional architecture of cortex, we combined labeling of the horizontal connections by retrograde transport of rhodamine-filled latex microspheres (beads) and labeling of the orientation columns by 2- deoxyglucose autoradiography. We first mapped the distribution of orientation columns in a small region of area 17 or 18, then made a small injection of beads into the center of an orientation column of defined specificity, and after allowing for retrograde transport, labeled vertical orientation columns with the 2-deoxyglucose technique. The retrogradely labeled cells were confined to regions of orientation specificity similar to that of the injection site, indicating that the horizontal connections run between columns of similar orientation specificity. This relationship was demonstrated for both the intrinsic horizontal and corticocortical connections. The extent of the horizontal connections, which allows single cells to integrate information over larger parts of the visual field than that covered by their receptive fields, and the functional specificity of the connections, suggests possible roles for these connections in visual processing."

Wurtz,1986.0,"<jats:p> Mechanisms of direction selectivity and speed selectivity were studied in single neurons of the middle temporal visual area (MT) of behaving macaque monkeys. Visual stimuli were presented in both smooth and stroboscopic motion within a neuron's receptive field as the monkey fixated a stationary point of light. Direction selectivity, speed selectivity, and the spontaneous discharge characteristics of MT neurons in behaving monkeys were similar to those reported in previous studies in anesthetized monkeys. Stroboscopic motion stimuli were sequences of flashes characterized by the spatial and temporal intervals between each flash. The spatial and temporal intervals were systematically varied so that suppressive and facilitatory interactions could be studied in both the preferred and null directions. Suppression and facilitation were measured by subtracting the peak discharge rate elicited by a single flash from the peak discharge rate elicited by a stroboscopic train of flashes. The dominant mechanism of direction selectivity in MT was a pronounced suppression of discharge for motion in the null direction which we interpreted as inhibition. The inhibition was sufficiently potent to abolish the responses to single flashed stimuli when they were embedded in a series of flashes in the null direction, and it frequently reduced the neuronal discharge to a level below the spontaneous firing rate. Facilitation in the preferred direction was a prominent feature of the responses of some, but not all, MT neurons. The peak discharge rate for stroboscopic motion in the preferred direction was more than twice the peak rate to a single flash for approximately 50% of the neurons in our sample. The direction selectivity of most MT neurons showed the effects of both inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms, and it was not possible to segregate MT neurons into distinct groups on the basis of these measures. Suppressive mechanisms contributed to speed tuning as well as direction tuning. The low-speed cutoff for motion in the preferred direction resulted from suppression in 82% of the neurons tested. The high-speed cutoff resulted from suppression in 32% of the neurons tested. The latter mechanism appeared to be distinct from the inhibitory mechanism which acted in the null direction in that large spatial intervals were required for its activation. "

Many cells in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) of the monkey that represent the foveal region of the visual field discharge during pursuit eye movements. Damage to these areas produces a deficit in the maintenance of pursuit eye movements when the target towards the side of the brain with the lesion. In the present experiments, we electrically stimulated these areas to better localize and understand the mechanisms underlying this directional pursuit deficit. 2. Monkeys were trained to pursue a moving target using a step-ramp task in which the target first stepped to an eccentric position and then moved smoothly across the screen. Trains of stimulation were applied after the monkey had begun to pursue the target to study stimulation effects of maintenance of pursuit. 3. Stimulation during pursuit frequently produced eye acceleration toward the side of the brain stimulated. Eye speed increased during pursuit toward the side stimulated and decreased during pursuit away from the side stimulated. This increase in velocity toward the side of the brain where stimulation presumably activated cells is consistent with the decrease in pursuit velocity toward the side of the brain after cells were removed by chemical lesions. 4. The increase or decrease in pursuit speed following stimulation produced a slip of the target on the retina. The pursuit system seemed to be insensitive to this slip during the period of stimulation, however, since the effect of stimulation during pursuit of a stabilized image (open-loop condition) was similar to that resulting from stimulation under normal pursuit conditions (closed-loop). This insensitivity to visual motion during stimulation suggests that the stimulation substitutes for that visual input. 5. The separation of eye and target position that resulted from stimulation did produce catch-up saccades. This provides added evidence that alteration of middle temporal area (MT) and medial superior temporal area (MST) modifies visual-motion but not visual-position information. 6. Stimulation that produced eye acceleration during pursuit produced only a slight effect during fixation of a stationary target. The effectiveness of the stimulation also increased as the speed of the pursuit increased between 5 and 25 degrees/s. These observations, which show that pursuit velocity altered the effect of stimulation, suggest that the stimulation acted on visual motion processing before information about the pursuit movement itself is incorporated. Since this stimulation produces directional pursuit effects, we hypothesize that the directional bias for pursuit originates in the visual signal conveyed to the pursuit system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

Komatsu,1988.0,"<jats:p> 1. We investigated cells in the middle temporal visual area (MT) and the medial superior temporal area (MST) that discharged during smooth pursuit of a dim target in an otherwise dark room. For each of these pursuit cells we determined whether the response during pursuit originated from visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target or from an extraretinal input related to the pursuit movement itself. We distinguished between these alternatives by removing the visual motion stimulus during pursuit either by blinking off the visual target briefly or by stabilizing the target on the retina. 2. In the foveal representation of MT (MTf), we found that pursuit cells usually decreased their rate of discharge during a blink or during stabilization of the visual target. The pursuit response of these cells depends on visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target. 3. In a dorsal-medial region of MST (MSTd), cells continued to respond during pursuit despite a blink or stabilization of the pursuit target. The pursuit response of these cells is dependent on an extraretinal input. 4. In a lateral-anterior region of MST (MST1), we found both types of pursuit cells; some, like those in MTf, were dependent on visual inputs whereas others, like those in MSTd, received an extraretinal input. 5. We observed a relationship between pursuit responses and passive visual responses. MST cells whose pursuit responses were attributable to extraretinal inputs tended to respond preferentially to large-field random-dot patterns. Some cells that preferred small spots also had an extraretinal input. 6. For 92% of the pursuit cells we studied, the pursuit response began after onset of the pursuit eye movement. A visual response preceding onset of the eye movement could be observed in many of these cells if the initial motion of the target occurred within the visual receptive field of the cell and in its preferred direction. In contrast to the pursuit response, however, this visual response was not dependent on execution of the pursuit movement. 7. For the remaining 8% of the pursuit cells, the pursuit discharge began before initiation of the pursuit eye movement. This occurred even though the initial motion of the target was outside the receptive field as mapped during fixation trials. Our data suggest, however, that such responses may be attributable to an expansion of the receptive field that accompanies enhanced visual responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

We tested this hypothesis by studying the effects of small chemical lesions of MT on eye movements made in response to moving as opposed to stationary visual targets. We observed two deficits for eye movements made to moving targets: a monkey's ability to match the speed of his smooth pursuit eye movements to the speed of the moving target was impaired, and a monkey's ability to adjust the amplitude of a saccadic eye movement to compensate for target motion was impaired. In contrast, saccades to stationary targets were unaffected by the MT lesions, suggesting that monkeys with MT lesions had more difficulty responding to moving than to stationary stimuli. These results provide the first behavioral evidence that neural processing in MT contributes to the cortical analysis of visual motion."

John,1985.0,"<jats:p>The effects of intergroup contact on stereotypic beliefs, it is argued, depend upon (1) the potential susceptibility of those beliefs to disconfirming information and the degree to which the contact setting “allows” for disconfirming events, and (2) the degree to which disconfirming events are generalized from specific group members to the group as a whole. To account for the generalization of attributes from a sample to a population, we present a cognitive‐processing model. The model assumes that impressions of groups are most heavily influenced by the attributes of those members most strongly associated with the group label. In order for group stereotypes to change, then, disconfirming information must be associated with the group labels. However, a number of powerful cognitive processes work against this association. As a consequence, we predict that stereotype change will be relatively rare under “normal” circumstances but may occur when disconfirming information is encountered under circumstances that activate the group label (e.g., when disconfirming attributes are associated with otherwise typical group members)."

The JNDs of one monkey (1.5 degree) were similar to those of humans; those of the other monkey were larger (5.8 degrees). We recorded from V1 neurons in these monkeys while they were performing the orientation discrimination with the same stimuli and under the same conditions as used in the behavioral testing. In order to determine how small a difference in orientation the V1 neurons can, in these conditions, signal reliably by small changes in firing rate, we performed 2 different receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. One ROC analysis was performed on the number of spikes evoked by the first of the 2 stimulus presentations as a function of the orientation of this stimulus. Neural JNDs derived from the neurometric curve were obtained in this way for 50 cells. In the second ROC analysis, the difference in the number of spikes evoked by the 2 stimuli presented in succession during 1 trial was analyzed as a function of orientation difference between the 2 stimuli. Neural JNDs were obtained by this procedure for 21 cells. These 2 complementary ROC analyses yielded very similar results. Also, the results were similar for the 2 monkeys. A minor fraction of V1 cells can reliably signal difference in orientation as small as 2.5 degrees, but none could signal differences smaller than 2 degrees. Our results also showed that the neural JND obtained by the ROC analysis depends on the duration of the interval during which spikes are counted. In these experiments, this duration could be chosen rather precisely, because the reaction times of the 2 monkeys were measured. Also, our results showed that the neural JND depends on the point of the tuning curve at which the measurement is made and is smallest when this is done on the steepest part of the tuning curve. Finally, our results show that the discriminative capacity of V1 neurons does not depend so much on each of the tuning characteristics--bandwidth, response strength, and variability--as on the combination of these factors."

This approach yielded several new results. First, the global distributions of labeled terminals revealed that both TEad and TEav projected to the ventrocaudal striatum, including the tail of the caudate nucleus and the adjacent ventral putamen, and the dorsolateral aspect of the deep amygdaloid nuclei. TEav also projected to the medial basal nucleus of the amygdala and the ventral striatum. Second, the reconstructed single axons (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 18) demonstrated that some axons originating from TEav or TEad projected simultaneously to the ventrocaudal striatum and the dorsolateral aspect of the deep amygdaloid nuclei by giving off collaterals. TEav axons projected to the medial basal nucleus of the amygdala also had collaterals projecting to the perirhinal cortex or area TG. And third, it was revealed that the axons originating from a focal TEav or TEad projected to a restricted territory (3.4–3.6 mm rostrocaudally) in the ventrocaudal striatum with four to six dispersed, rostrocaudally elongated, rod-like modules. Individual axons with multiple arbors innervated many of these modules. These findings add the evidence that the anterior part of TE is anatomically heterogeneous and suggest that the deep amygdaloid nuclei may be functionally dissociated, with the dorsolateral aspect more closely related to the ventrocaudal striatum and the medial basal nucleus more closely related to the perirhinal cortex."

In the present study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do not appear to be “detectors” for complex objects, we did find a separate population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of faces in IT cortex."

A color stimulus was presented at the center of the visual field while the animal performed a fixation task. The responses of single units to various colors were recorded and were plotted in a color space. The color space was based on the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) chromaticity diagram. Quantitative analysis of the color selectivity was performed using a standard set of colors that were evenly distributed in the color space. Sixty-five neurons recorded from eight guide tubes implanted in anterior part of IT cortex were tested quantitatively, and their color selectivity was statistically evaluated. Forty-six of them (71%) were classified as color selective. Color-selective cells responded to some colors but not to others, and we called the responsive region in the color space the “color field.” The location and the size of a cell's color field were largely independent of the luminance of the stimulus. About 80% of the color-selective neurons had color fields consisting of a single responsive region that were restricted in some part of the color space, and the remaining cells had more than one responsive region within the color space. Preferred hues of the color-selective neurons differed from cell to cell. The population of cells together covered nearly all of the color space. There was a tendency for more color-selective cells to be less sensitive to white and desaturated cyans. Some of the cells with color fields that consisted of more than one responsive region were more sensitive to saturation of the stimulus than to its hue. Although previous electrophysiological studies in IT cortex emphasized the pattern selectivity of the neurons, our results suggest that color is an important factor in the role that IT cortex plays in the object recognition."

The responses of single neurons in the anterior part of the temporal cortex in monkeys, mainly the temporopolar cortex, area 36, and the most anterior part of area TE of von Bonin and Bailey (1947) (these areas were designated here as the temporal pole), were examined during the performance of a visual recognition memory task. The visual stimulus (sample stimulus) was presented when the monkey pressed a lever. The same sample stimulus was presented one to four times and, thereafter, a new stimulus was presented. The monkeys were trained to discriminate the new stimulus from the sample stimulus and to release the lever in response to the new stimulus. We used colored photographs of natural objects (human faces, monkeys, foods, and non-food objects) as complex visual stimuli or computer-generated two-dimensional shapes (a red square, a green circle, etc.) as simple visual stimuli. 2. In total, the activity of 311 neurons was recorded, and 225 of these responded to at least one visual stimulus. All visually responsive neurons were located in the ventral part of the temporal pole including the banks of the superior temporal sulcus. 3. The relationship between the monkey's eye movements and visual responses was investigated. Visual response properties, such as the number of spikes, onset latency, and response duration, were stable regardless of the monkey's eye positions and movements if the eyes were directed to the display. We also examined the receptive field property of neurons (n = 3). The neurons tested in the temporal pole tended to have a large receptive field (24 x 24 degrees). 4. The neurons tended to respond to different stimuli in different magnitudes. In each case, the maximal responses were elicited by complex, colored photographs, whereas simple, two-dimensional colored shapes elicited little or no responses. In 21% of the cases (47/225), the magnitude of the maximal response was significantly larger than for any of the other responses. 5. An achromatic version of the stimulus that induced the maximal response was tested in 53 neurons. About 80% of the neurons (41/53) responded to the achromatic stimulus at a magnitude that was not significantly different from the response to the original stimulus. In 12 neurons, the removal of color did significantly decrease the magnitude of the response. When other colors were tested, 3 of 9 neurons were found to code for color. 6. In 21 of these 53 neurons, a portion (the left-, right-, upper-, or lower-half) of the stimulus was also tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

To analyze the selectivity and the sparseness of firing to visual stimuli of single neurons in the primate temporal cortical visual area, neuronal responses were measured to a set of 68 visual stimuli in macaques performing a visual fixation task. The population of neurons analyzed had responses that occurred primarily to faces. The stimuli included 23 faces, and 45 nonface images of real-world scenes, so that the function of this brain region could be analyzed when it was processing natural scenes. 2. The neurons were selected to meet the previously used criteria of face selectivity by responding more than twice as much to the optimal face as to the optimal nonface stimulus in the set. Application of information theoretic analyses to the responses of these neurons confirmed that their responses contained much more information about which of 20 face stimuli had been seen (on average 0.4 bits) than about which (of 20) nonface stimuli had been seen (on average 0.07 bits). 3. The sparseness of the representation of a scene or object provided by each of these neurons (which can be thought of as the proportion of stimuli to which the neuron responds, and which is fundamental to understanding the network operation of the system) can be defined as [formula: see text] where ri is the firing rate to the ith stimulus in the set of n stimuli. The sparseness has a maximal value of 1.0. It was found that the sparseness of the representation of the 68 stimuli by each neuron had an average across all neurons of 0.65. This indicates a rather distributed representation. 4. If the spontaneous firing rate was subtracted from the firing rate of the neuron to each stimulus, so that the changes of firing rate, i.e., the responses of the neurons, were used in the sparseness calculation, then the ""response sparseness"" had a lower value, with a mean of 0.33 for the population of neurons, or 0.60 if calculated over the set of faces. 5. Multidimensional scaling to produce a stimulus space represented by this population of neurons showed that the different faces were well separated in the space created, whereas the different nonface stimuli were grouped together in the space. 6. The information analyses and multidimensional scaling provided evidence that what was made explicit in the responses of these neurons was information about which face had been seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

These sectors, including the sulcal proisocortex (area Pro), are tied together in a sequence of reciprocal connections. Each rostrocaudal sector of area TPO also has reciprocal connections with the laterally adjacent area TAa, at the upper rim of the sulcus, and medially adjacent areas PGa and IPa, near the depth. A similar architectonic/ connectional organization exists for unimodal vision‐related cortex in the lower bank of the STS. Here a rostrocaudal sequence of reciprocal connections unites area Pro, rostral and caudal divisions of area TEa, and the extrastriate visual area OAa (MT). Area TEa also has reciprocal connections with adjacent segments of area TEm laterally, at the lower rim of the sulcus, and area IPa, medially, in the depth. In both upper and lower banks, caudal‐to‐rostral “for‐wardgoing” connections begin in supragranular layers of cortex and terminate in and around layer IV. Reciprocal, “backgoing” connections take origin from cells in infragranular layers and terminate mainly over the first layer of the caudally adjacent target zone. Orthogonally directed, “side‐to‐side” projections originate in both supra‐ and infragranular layers and terminate diffusely over all layers of cortex."

To infer relative roles of cortical areas at different stages of the ventral visual pathway, we quantitatively examined visual responses of cells in V2, V4, the posterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (posterior IT), and the anterior part of the inferotemporal cortex (anterior IT), using anesthetized macaque monkeys. 2. The critical feature for the activation was first determined for each recorded cell by using a reduction method. We started from images of three-dimensional complex objects and simplified the image of effective stimuli step by step by eliminating a part of the features present in the image. The simplest feature that maximally activated the cell was determined as the critical feature. The response to the critical feature was then compared with responses of the same cell to a routine set of 32 simple stimuli, which included white and black bars of four different orientations and squares or spots of four different colors. 3. Cells that responded maximally to particular complex object features were found in posterior IT and V4 as well as in anterior IT. The cells in posterior IT and V4 were, however, different from the cells in anterior IT in that many of them responded to some extent to some simple features, that the size of the receptive field was small, and that they intermingled in single penetrations with cells that responded maximally to some simple features. The complex critical features in posterior IT and V4 varied; they consisted of complex shapes, combinations of a shape and texture, and combinations of a shape and color. 4. We suggest that local neuronal networks in V4 and posterior IT play an essential role in the formation of selective responses to complex object features. "

               <jats:p>The disabilities experienced by colour-blind people show us the biological advantages of colour vision in detecting targets, in segregating the visual field and in identifying particular objects or states. Human dichromats have especial difficulty in detecting coloured fruit against dappled foliage that varies randomly in luminosity; it is suggested that yellow and orange tropical fruits have co-evolved with the trichromatic colour vision of Old World monkeys. It is argued that the colour vision of man and of the Old World monkeys depends on two subsystems that remain parallel and independent at early stages of the visual pathway. The primordial subsystem, which is shared with most mammals, depends on a comparison of the rates of quantum catch in the short-and middle-wave cones; this system exists almost exclusively for colour vision, although the chromatic signals carry with them a local sign that allows them to sustain several of the functions of spatiochromatic vision. The second subsystem arose from the phylogenetically recent duplication of a gene on the X-chromosome, and depends on a comparison of the rates of quantum catch in the long-and middle-wave receptors. At the early stages of the visual pathway, this chromatic information is carried by a channel that is also sensitive to spatial contrast. The New World monkeys have taken a different route to trichromacy: in species that are basically dichromatic, heterozygous females gain trichromacy as a result of X-chromosome inactivation, which ensures that different photopigments are expressed in two subsets of retinal photoreceptor."

Measurements of the magnitude and time course of response were made from 44 cells responsive to static head views at different levels of stimulus effectiveness. In this way responses to complex stimulus patterns evoking good, poor, and midrange responses could be compared across the cell population. 2. Cells exhibiting both good and poor initial discrimination between head views were found at short and long latencies; there was no correlation of any of the temporal response parameters measured with cell response latency. 3. The time course of the population response to the most effective stimuli showed a rapid increase to a peak firing rate (onset to peak, rise time, 58 ms) that was on average 115 spikes/s above spontaneous activity (S/A), followed by slower decay (decay time, 93 ms) to a maintained discharge rate (15% of the peak rate above S/A). 4. Discrimination between responses to different head views exhibited by the population showed a sharp rise and reached highly significant levels within 25 ms after the population's response onset. 5. On average, activity in a single neuron (the Average Cell) rises to 44% of its peak response rate within 5 ms of the response onset. 6. The Average Cell also showed exceptionally fast discrimination between views, significant within 5 ms of response onset. 7. It is argued that the fast rise in firing rate, followed by a decay to a lower rate and the very fast emergence of discrimination are features of pattern processing present in real neural systems that are lacking in many processing models based on artificial networks of neuronlike elements, particularly those where discrimination relies on top-down and/or lateral competitive inhibition. 8. It is concluded that the only way to account for the rapid discrimination is to consider a coding system in which the first spike from multiple sources is used to transmit information between stages of processing.

A series of high-pass and low-pass spatially filtered versions of a visual scene were generated. Observers' ratings of these filtered versions of the scene for perceived image quality indicated that quality was determined both by the bandwidth of spatial information and the presence of high-spatial-frequency edge information. When sequences of three different versions of the scene were presented over an interval of 120 ms the perceived quality of the resulting composite image was determined both from the ratings of the individual components of that sequence and from the order in which these components were presented. When the order of spatial information in a sequence moved from coarse to fine detail the perceived quality of the composite image was significantly better than when the order moved from fine to coarse. This evidence of a coarse-to-fine bias in pattern integration was further investigated with a detection paradigm. The pattern of errors once again indicated that temporal integration of spatial information was superior when a coarse-to-fine mode of information delivery was employed. Taken together the data indicate that the pattern-integration mechanism has an inherent order bias and does not accumulate spatial information so efficiently when the ‘natural’ coarse-to-fine order is violated.

In addition incongruent colour disrupted naming accuracy. These effects tended to be larger on objects from structurally similar classes than on objects from structurally dissimilar classes. Experiment 1b examined superordinate classification. There were again advantages due to congruent colour and photographic detail on responses to objects from both structurally similar and structurally dissimilar classes. Incongruent colour disrupted classification accuracy on structurally distinct but not structurally similar items. For structurally similar items, the advantages of congruent surface attributes on classification were smaller than on naming, but this was not the case for structurally dissimilar items. Experiment 2 examined subordinate classification of structurally similar objects. Now effects of congruent and incongruent colour, but not of photographic detail, were found. Experiment 3 showed that congruent and incongruent colour effects occur only when the colours occupy the internal surfaces of objects. The results suggest that surface details can affect object recognition and naming, depending upon: (1) the degree to which objects must be differentiated for a correct response to be made, and (2) the nature of the rate-limiting process determining performance.

These include the lateral and ventral surfaces of inferior temporal cortex and the upper bank, lower bank and fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Cells in the different regions may contribute in different ways to the processing of the facial image. Within the upper bank of the STS different populations of cells are selective for different views of the face and head. These cells occur in functionally discrete patches (3-5 mm across) within the STS cortex. Studies of output connections from the STS also reveal a modular anatomical organization of repeating 3-5 mm patches connected to the parietal cortex, an area thought to be involved in spatial awareness and in the control of attention. The properties of some cells suggest a role in the discrimination of heads from other objects, and in the recognition of familiar individuals. The selectivity for view suggests that the neural operations underlying face or head recognition rely on parallel analyses of different characteristic views of the head, the outputs of these view-specific analyses being subsequently combined to support view-independent (object-centred) recognition. An alternative functional interpretation of the sensitivity to head view is that the cells enable an analysis of ‘social attention’, i.e. they signal where other individuals are directing their attention. A cell maximally responsive to the left profile thus provides a signal that the attention (of another individual) is directed to the observer’s left. Such information is useful for analysing social interactions between other individuals. This interpretation accounts not only for the extensive tuning to head view in the horizontal plane, but also explains the additional tuning of many STS cells to gaze direction and vertical elevation of the head and body posture. Deficits in perception of gaze direction after lesions to the macaque STS cortex, and in certain cases of prosopagnosia, are also predicted by this interpretation."

One solution to this problem, categorical perception, is known primarily from human speech, but also occurs in other modalities and in some mammals and birds. Categorical perception was tested in crickets by using two paradigms of human psychophysics, labeling and habituation-dishabituation. The results show that crickets divide sound frequency categorically between attractive (&lt;16 kilohertz) and repulsive (&gt;16 kilohertz) sounds. There is sharp discrimination between these categories but no discrimination between different frequencies of ultrasound. This demonstration of categorical perception in an invertebrate suggests that categorical perception may be a basic and widespread feature of sensory systems, from humans to invertebrates."

Erickson; Robert Desimone,1996.0,"<jats:p>Prefrontal (PF) cells were studied in monkeys performing a delayed matching to sample task, which requires working memory. The stimuli were complex visual patterns and to solve the task, the monkeys had to discriminate among the stimuli, maintain a memory of the sample stimulus during the delay periods, and evaluate whether a test stimulus matched the sample presented earlier in the trial. PF cells have properties consistent with a role in all three of these operations. Approximately 25% of the cells responded selectively to different visual stimuli. Half of the cells showed heightened activity during the delay after the sample and, for many of these cells, the magnitude of delay activity was selective for different samples. Finally, more than half of the cells responded differently to the test stimuli depending on whether they matched the sample. Because inferior temporal (IT) cortex also is important for working memory, we compared PF cells with IT cells studied in the same task. Compared with IT cortex, PF responses were less often stimulus-selective but conveyed more information about whether a given test stimulus was a match to the sample. Furthermore, sample-selective delay activity in PF cortex was maintained throughout the trial even when other test stimuli intervened during the delay, whereas delay activity in IT cortex was disrupted by intervening stimuli. The results suggest that PF cortex plays a primary role in working memory tasks and may be a source of feedback inputs to IT cortex, biasing activity in favor of behaviorally relevant stimuli."

Then, after a delay, a test object was presented. If the test object was the object associated with the sample during training (i.e., its target), they had to release a lever. Monkeys could bridge the delay by remembering the sample (a sensory-related code) and/or thinking ahead to the expected target (a prospective code). Examination of the monkeys’ behavior suggested that they were relying on a prospective code. During and shortly after sample presentation, neural activity in the lateral PF cortex primarily reflected the sample. Toward the end of the delay, however, PF activity began to reflect the anticipated target, which indicated a prospective code. These results provide further confirmation that PF cortex does not simply buffer incoming visual inputs, but instead selectively processes information relevant to current behavioral demands, even when this information must be recalled from long-term memory."

When an object can only be distinguished by an arrangement of its parts along more than one dimension, people mentally rotate it to a familiar orientation.

Three recently proposed theories of object recognition--viewpoint normalization or alignment of three-dimensional models [Ullman, S.

We have exploited the conflicting predictions to test the three theories directly in a psychophysical experiment involving computer-generated three-dimensional objects. Our results suggest that the human visual system is better described as recognizing these objects by two-dimensional view interpolation than by alignment or other methods that rely on object-centered three-dimensional models."

A theory is reported that shows the equivalence between regularization and a class of three-layer networks called regularization networks or hyper basis functions.

Because lesions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex interfere with a monkey's ability to perform pattern discrimination tasks we studied IT neurons. Previous single-unit studies have shown that IT neurons sometimes respond more strongly to complex stimuli (brushes, hands, faces) than to simple stimuli (bars, slits, edges). However, it is not known how specific stimulus parameters are represented by responses. We studied the responses of IT neurons in alert behaving monkeys to a large set of two-dimensional black and white patterns. The stimulus set was based on 64 Walsh functions that can be used to represent any picture with a resolution of one part in eight along each of two dimensions. The responses to these stimuli spanned a continuum from inhibition to strong excitation. A statistical test showed that the spike count was determined by which Walsh stimulus was presented. Hence, these stimuli form an adequate set for testing IT neurons. The responses showed temporal modulation of the spike train that could not be represented by a change in the spike count alone. Examples of this modulation were changes in latency, changes in the duration of the response, and alternating periods of excitation and inhibition. This temporal modulation may be important in representing stimulus parameters. The next paper in this series develops a method for quantifying this temporal modulation and shows that it is dependent on the stimulus. The third paper in this series shows that this temporal modulation contains more information about stimulus parameters than is contained in the spike count alone. "

The inferotemporal cortex (IT) has been thought to play an essential and specific role in visual object discrimination and recognition, because a lesion of IT in the monkey results in a specific deficit in learning tasks that require these visual functions. To understand the cellular basis of the object discrimination and recognition processes in IT, we determined the optimal stimulus of individual IT cells in anesthetized, immobilized monkeys. 2. In the posterior one-third or one-fourth of IT, most cells could be activated maximally by bars or disks just by adjusting the size, orientation, or color of the stimulus. 3. In the remaining anterior two-thirds or three-quarters of IT, most cells required more complex features for their maximal activation. 4. The critical feature for the activation of individual anterior IT cells varied from cell to cell: a complex shape in some cells and a combination of texture or color with contour-shape in other cells. 5. Cells that showed different types of complexity for the critical feature were intermingled throughout anterior IT, whereas cells recorded in single penetrations showed critical features that were related in some respects. 6. Generally speaking, the critical features of anterior IT cells were moderately complex and can be thought of as partial features common to images of several different natural objects. The selectivity to the optimal stimulus was rather sharp, although not absolute. We thus propose that, in anterior IT, images of objects are coded by combinations of active cells, each of which represents the presence of a particular partial feature in the image. "

Inferior temporal cortex (IT) is a ""high-order"" region of primate temporal visual cortex implicated in visual pattern perception and recognition. To gain some insight into the development of this area, we compared the properties of single neurons in IT in infant monkeys ranging from 5 wk to 7 mo of age with those of neurons in IT in adult animals. Both anesthetized and awake behaving paradigms were used. 2. In immobilized infant monkeys under nitrous oxide anesthesia, the incidence of visually responsive cells was markedly less than in adult monkeys studied under similar conditions. In infants 4-7 mo of age, only half of IT neurons studied were visually responsive, compared with &gt; 80% in adult monkeys. In monkeys &lt; 4 mo old, even fewer (&lt; 10%) could be visually driven. ""Habituation"" of IT cells to repeated stimulus presentation appeared more pronounced in infant monkeys under nitrous oxide anesthesia than in adult animals. 3. IT cells in the anesthetized infant monkeys that did respond showed receptive field properties similar to those of responsive adult IT neurons studied under similar conditions. Two thirds of the receptive fields plotted in the anesthetized 4 to 7-mo-old group were bilateral, and median field size did not differ between the infants and comparable adult groups, being approximately 20 degrees on a side in each case. 4. In contrast to the results obtained under anesthesia, most IT cells in alert infant monkeys 5 wk-7 mo of age (80%) were responsive to visual stimuli, and this incidence of visually responsive IT neurons did not differ from that obtained in awake adult macaques. However, response magnitude, measured as spikes per second above baseline rate, was significantly lower in the infant alert sample than in the adult control (5.2 vs. 12.6 spikes/s, mean +/- SE, deviation from spontaneous rate, respectively). 5. In addition to having lower magnitudes of visual response, IT cells in the awake infants also tended to have longer and more variable latencies. The overall mean for the infant cells was 196 ms, compared with an overall mean of 140 ms for IT neurons in the alert control adult. 6. Although the magnitude of response of neurons in alert infant IT cortex was lower overall, the incidence and features of stimulus selectivity shown by alert infant IT neurons were strikingly similar to those of IT cells of both anesthetized and unanesthetized adult monkeys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

We have studied the effects of these signals in a region of the macaque temporal cortex where cells have been found to be responsive to the sight of faces. Of cells selectively responsive to the sight of the face or head but not to other objects (182 cells) 63% were sensitive to the orientation of the head. Different views of the head (full face, profile, back or top of the head, face rotated by 45° up to the ceiling or down to the floor) maximally activated different classes of cell. All classes of cell, however, remained active as the preferred view was rotated isomorphically or was changed in size or distance. Isomorphic rotation by 90–180° increased cell response latencies by 10–60 ms. Sensitivity to gaze direction was found for 64% of the cells tested that were tuned to head orientation. Eighteen cells most responsive to the full face preferred eye contact, while 18 cells tuned to the profile face preferred averted gaze. Sensitivity to gaze was thus compatible with, but could be independent of, sensitivity to head orientation. Results suggest that the recognition of one type of object may proceed via the independent high level analysis of several restricted views of the object (viewer-centred descriptions)."

Based on these findings it is suggested that, for homogeneous classes whose members share a common configuration, distinctive configural information may be coded as metric deviations from a spatial norm. Experiments are described which demonstrate similar distinctiveness effects in bird identification. Transformations that increase distinctiveness (caricatures) produced faster identification and a higher recognition proportion, for both experts and nonexperts, than transformations that reduce distinctiveness (anticaricatures). This distinctiveness advantage is consistent with the norm-based coding idea. Furthermore, within certain limits, increasing distinctiveness did not impair performance relative to that for veridical drawings. For experts there was also a caricature advantage, such that 50% caricatures of birds in a highly homogeneous and familiar class (passerines) were identified more quickly, provided that they were recognized at all, than uncaricatured veridical drawings. The significance of a caricature advantage for the visual coding of configural information is discussed. "

Separate scans were obtained while subjects performed face matching, location matching, or sensorimotor control tasks. The matching tasks used identical stimuli for some scans and stimuli of equivalent visual complexity for others. Face matching was associated with selective rCBF increases in the fusiform gyrus in occipital and occipitotemporal cortex bilaterally and in a right prefrontal area in the inferior frontal gyrus. Location matching was associated with selective rCBF increases in dorsal occipital, superior parietal, and intraparietal sulcus cortex bilaterally and in dorsal right premotor cortex. Decreases in rCBF, relative to the sensorimotor control task, were observed for both matching tasks in auditory, auditory association, somatosensory, and midcingulate cortex. These results suggest that, within a sensory modality, selective attention is associated with increased activity in those cortical areas that process the attended information but is not associated with decreased activity in areas that process unattended visual information. Selective attention to one sensory modality, on the other hand, is associated with decreased activity in cortical areas dedicated to processing input from other sensory modalities. Direct comparison of our results with those from other PET-rCBF studies of extrastriate cortex demonstrates agreement in the localization of cortical areas mediating face and location perception and dissociations between these areas and those mediating the perception of color and motion."

Bilateral regions of the posterior fusiform gyrus were activated by faces viewed among nonobjects, but when viewed among objects, faces activated only a focal right fusiform region. To determine whether this focal activation would occur for another category of familiar stimuli, subjects viewed flowers presented among nonobjects and objects. While flowers among nonobjects evoked bilateral fusiform activation, flowers among objects evoked no activation. These results demonstrate that both faces and flowers activate large and partially overlapping regions of inferior extrastriate cortex.

               <jats:p>In order to study face recognition in relative isolation from visual processes that may also contribute to object recognition and reading, we investigated CK, a man with normal face recognition but with object agnosia and dyslexia caused by a closed-head injury. We administered recognition tests of up right faces, of family resemblance, of age-transformed faces, of caricatures, of cartoons, of inverted faces, and of face features, of disguised faces, of perceptually degraded faces, of fractured faces, of faces parts, and of faces whose parts were made of objects. We compared CK's performance with that of at least 12 control participants. We found that CK performed as well as controls as long as the face was upright and retained the configurational integrity among the internal facial features, the eyes, nose, and mouth. This held regardless of whether the face was disguised or degraded and whether the face was represented as a photo, a caricature, a cartoon, or a face composed of objects. In the last case, CK perceived the face but, unlike controls, was rarely aware that it was composed of objects. When the face, or just the internal features, were inverted or when the configurational gestalt was broken by fracturing the face or misaligning the top and bottom halves, CK's performance suffered far more than that of controls. We conclude that face recognition normally depends on two systems: (1) a holistic, face-specific system that is dependent on orientationspecific coding of second-order relational features (internal), which is intact in CK and (2) a part-based object-recognition system, which is damaged in CK and which contributes to face recognition when the face stimulus does not satisfy the domain-specific conditions needed to activate the face system."

These findings suggest a category-specific anatomically segregated modular organization of the object vision pathway. Here we present data from a functional MRI study in which we found three distinct regions of ventral temporal cortex that responded preferentially to faces and two categories of other objects, namely houses and chairs, and had a highly consistent topological arrangement. Although the data could be interpreted as evidence for separate modules, we found that each category also evoked significant responses in the regions that responded maximally to other stimuli. Moreover, each category was associated with its own differential pattern of response across ventral temporal cortex. These results indicate that the representation of an object is not restricted to a region that responds maximally to that object, but rather is distributed across a broader expanse of cortex. We propose that the functional architecture of the ventral visual pathway is not a mosaic of category-specific modules but instead is a continuous representation of information about object form that has a highly consistent and orderly topological arrangement."

Bub; Martin Arguin,1998.0,"<jats:p> Prosopagnosia is the neuropathological inability to recognize familiar people by their faces. It can occur in isolation or can coincide with recognition deficits for other nonface objects. Often, patients whose prosopagnosia is accompanied by object recognition difficulties have more trouble identifying certain categories of objects relative to others. In previous research, we demonstrated that objects that shared multiple visual features and were semantically close posed severe recognition difficulties for a patient with temporal lobe damage. We now demonstrate that this patient's face recognition is constrained by these same parameters. The prosopagnosic patient ELM had difficulties pairing faces to names when the faces shared visual features and the names were semantically related (e.g., Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and Josée Chouinard— three ice skaters). He made tenfold fewer errors when the exact same faces were associated with semantically unrelated people (e.g., singer Celine Dion, actress Betty Grable, and First Lady Hillary Clinton). We conclude that prosopagnosia and co-occurring category-specific recognition problems both stem from difficulties disambiguating the stored representations of objects that share multiple visual features and refer to semantically close identities or concepts.

               <jats:p>We argue that the current literature on prosopagnosia fails to demonstrate unequivocal evidence for a disproportionate impairment for faces as compared to nonface objects. Two prosopagnosic subjects were tested for the discrimination of objects from several categories (face as well as nonface) at different levels of categorization (basic, subordinate, and exemplar levels). Several dependent measures were obtained including accuracy, signal detection measures, and response times. The results from Experiments 1 to 4 demonstrate that, in simultaneous-matching tasks, response times may reveal impairments with nonface objects in subjects whose error rates only indicate a face deficit. The results from Experiments 5 and 6 show that, given limited stimulus presentation times for face and nonface objects, the same subjects may demonstrate a deªcit for both stimulus categories in sensitivity. In Experiments 7, 8 and 9, a match-to-sample task that places greater demands on memory led to comparable recognition sensitivity with both face and nonface objects. Regardless of object category, the prosopagnosic subjects were more affected by manipulations of the level of categorization than normal controls. This result raises questions regarding neuropsychological evidence for the modularity of face recognition, as well as its theoretical and methodological foundations."

Taking holistic representation to mean representation without an internal part structure, we interpret the available evidence on this issue and then design new empirical tests. Based on previous research, we reasoned that if a portion of an object corresponds to an explicitly represented part in a hierarchical visual representation, then when that portion is presented in isolation it will be identified relatively more easily than if it did not have the status of an explicitly represented part. The hypothesis that face recognition is holistic therefore predicts that a part of a face will be disproportionately more easily recognized in the whole face than as an isolated part, relative to recognition of the parts and wholes of other kinds of stimuli. This prediction was borne out in three experiments: subjects were more accurate at identifying the parts of faces, presented in the whole object, than they were at identifying the same part presented in isolation, even though both parts and wholes were tested in a forced-choice format and the whole faces differed only by one part. In contrast, three other types of stimuli–-scrambled faces, inverted faces, and houses–-did not show this advantage for part identification in whole object recognition. "

Spitzer,1990.0,"<jats:p> 1. Previously we developed a new approach for investigating visual system neuronal activity in which single neurons are considered to be communication channels transmitting stimulus-dependent codes in their responses. Application of this approach to the stimulus-response relations of inferior temporal (IT) neurons showed that these carry stimulus-dependent information in the temporal modulation as well as in the strength of their responses. IT cortex is a late station in the visual processing stream. Presumably the neuronal properties arise from the properties of the inputs. However, the discovery that IT neuronal spike trains transmit information in stimulus-dependent temporally modulated codes could not be assumed to be true for those earlier stations, so the techniques used in the earlier study were applied to single-striate cortical neurons in the studies reported here. 2. Single-striate cortical neurons were recorded from three awake, fixating rhesus monkeys. The neurons were stimulated by two sets of patterns. The first set was made up of 128 black-and-white patterns based on a complete, orthogonal set of two-dimensional Walsh-Hadamard functions. These stimuli appear as combinations of black-and-white rectangles and squares, and they fully span the range of all possible black-and-white pictures that can be constructed in an 8 x 8 grid. Except for the stimulus that appeared as an all-white or all-black square, each stimulus had equal areas of white and black. The second stimulus set was made up of single bars constructed in the same 8 x 8 grid as the Walsh stimuli. These were presented both as black against a gray background and white against a gray background. The stimuli were centered on the receptive field, and each member of the stimulus set was presented once before any stimulus appeared again. 3. The responses of 21 striate cortical neurons were recorded and analyzed. Two were identified as simple cells and the other 19 as complex cells according to the criteria originally used by Hubel and Wiesel. The stimulus set elicited a wide variety of response strengths and patterns from each neuron. The responses from both the bars and the Walsh set could be used to differentiate and classify simple and complex cells. 4. The responses of both simple and complex cells showed striking stimulus-related strength and temporal modulation. For all of the complex cells there were instances where the responses to a stimulus and its contrast-reversed mate were substantially different in response strength or pattern, or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

The activity of neurons in many brain structures can be modulated by the attentional state of the animal. Attention directed toward a particular external stimulus is often reflected in an enhancement of the sensory response to that stimulus. Enhancement is spatially selective for neurons in many areas and explicitly eye-movement related in most. Attention directed toward the internal representation of a stimulus may be associated with a prolongation of neural activity. These modulations of neuronal responsiveness underscore the dynamic nature of neural processing. Competition between left- and right-brain structures in the control of attention is common. While attention is perceived as a unitary process, it is subserved by many brain structures. Given the wide distribution of attentional processes, it is not surprising that children diagnosed as having attentional deficits show considerable diversity in symptoms and etiology.

Neurophysiol. 80: 2918–2940, 1998. A typical scene will contain many different objects, few of which are relevant to behavior at any given moment. Thus attentional mechanisms are needed to select relevant objects for visual processing and control over behavior. We examined this role of attention in the inferior temporal cortex of macaque monkeys, using a visual search paradigm. While the monkey maintained fixation, a cue stimulus was presented at the center of gaze, followed by a blank delay period. After the delay, an array of two to five choice stimuli was presented extrafoveally, and the monkey was rewarded for detecting a target stimulus matching the cue. The behavioral response was a saccadic eye movement to the target in one version of the task and a lever release in another. The array was composed of one “good” stimulus (effective in driving the cell when presented alone) and one or more “poor” stimuli (ineffective in driving the cell when presented alone). Most cells showed higher delay activity after a good stimulus used as the cue than after a poor stimulus. The baseline activity of cells was also higher preceding a good cue, if the animal expected it to occur. This activity may depend on a top-down bias in favor of cells coding the relevant stimulus. When the choice array was presented, most cells showed suppressive interactions between the stimuli as well as strong attention effects. When the choice array was presented in the contralateral visual field, most cells initially responded the same, regardless of which stimulus was the target. However, within 150–200 ms of array onset, responses were determined by the target stimulus. If the target was the good stimulus, the response to the array became equal to the response to the good stimulus presented alone. If the target was a poor stimulus, the response approached the response to that stimulus presented alone. Thus the influence of the nontarget stimulus was eliminated. These effects occurred well in advance of the behavioral response. When the array was positioned with stimuli on opposite sides of the vertical meridian, the contralateral stimulus appeared to dominate the response, and this dominant effect could not be overcome by attention. Overall, the results support a “biased competition” model of attention, according to which 1) objects in the visual field compete for representation in the cortex, and 2) this competition is biased in favor of the behaviorally relevant object by virtue of “top-down” feedback from structures involved in working memory.

Neurophysiol. 78: 199–213, 1997. Burst activity, defined by groups of two or more spikes with intervals of ≤8 ms, was analyzed in responses to drifting sinewave gratings elicited from striate cortical neurons in anesthetized cats. Bursting varied broadly across a population of 507 simple and complex cells. Half of this population had ≥42% of their spikes contained in bursts. The fraction of spikes in bursts did not vary as a function of average firing rate and was stationary over time. Peaks in the interspike interval histograms were found at both 3–5 ms and 10–30 ms. In many cells the locations of these peaks were independent of firing rate, indicating a quantized control of firing behavior at two different time scales. The activity at the shorter time scale most likely results from intrinsic properties of the cell membrane, and that at the longer scale from recurrent network excitation. Burst frequency (bursts per s) and burst length (spikes per burst) both depended on firing rate. Burst frequency was essentially linear with firing rate, whereas burst length was a nonlinear function of firing rate and was also governed by stimulus orientation. At a given firing rate, burst length was greater for optimal orientations than for nonoptimal orientations. No organized orientation dependence was seen in bursts from lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Activation of cortical contrast gain control at low response amplitudes resulted in no burst length modulation, but burst shortening at optimal orientations was found in responses characterized by supersaturation. At a given firing rate, cortical burst length was shortened by microinjection of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and bursts became longer in the presence of N-methyl-bicuculline, a GABA<jats:sub>A</jats:sub> receptor blocker. These results are consistent with a model in which responses are reduced at nonoptimal orientations, at least in part, by burst shortening that is mediated by GABA. A similar mechanism contributes to response supersaturation at high contrasts via recruitment of inhibitory responses that are tuned to adjacent orientations. Burst length modulation can serve as a form of coding by supporting dynamic, stimulus-dependent reorganization of the effectiveness of individual network connections. "

Effects of shape-discrimination training on the selectivity of inferotemporal cells in adult monkeys. J. Neurophysiol. 80: 324–330, 1998. Through extensive training, humans can become “visual experts,” able to visually distinguish subtle differences among similar objects with greater ease than those who are untrained. To understand the neural mechanisms behind this acquired discrimination ability, adult monkeys were fully trained to discriminate 28 moderately complex shapes. The training effects on the stimulus selectivity of cells in area TE of the inferotemporal cortex were then examined in anesthetized preparations. Area TE represents a later stage of the ventral visual cortical pathway that is known to mediate visual object discrimination and recognition. The recordings from the trained monkeys and untrained controls showed that the proportion of TE cells responsive to some member of the 28 stimuli was significantly greater in the trained monkeys than that in the control monkeys. Cell responses recorded from the trained monkeys were not sharply tuned to single training stimuli, but rather broadly covered several training stimuli. The distances among the training stimuli in the response space spanned by responses of the recorded TE cells were significantly greater in the trained monkeys than those in the control monkeys. The subset of training stimuli to which individual cells responded differed from cell to cell with only partial overlaps, suggesting that the cells responded to features common to several stimuli.

Salcman,1985.0,"<jats:p> Simultaneous recordings were made from small collections (2-7) of spontaneously active single units in the striate cortex of unanesthetized cats, by means of chronically implanted electrodes. The recorded spike trains were computer scanned for bursts of spikes, and the bursts were catalogued and studied. The firing rates of the neurons ranged from 0.16 to 32 spikes/s; the mean was 8.9 spikes/s, the standard deviation 7.0 spikes/s. Bursts of spikes were assigned a quantitative measure, termed Poisson surprise (S), defined as the negative logarithm of their probability in a random (Poisson) spike train. Only bursts having S greater than 10, corresponding to an occurrence rate of about 0.01 bursts/1,000 spikes in a random spike train, were considered to be of interest. Bursts having S greater than 10 occurred at a rate of about 5-15 bursts/1,000 spikes, or about 1-5 bursts/min. The rate slightly increased with spike rate; averaging about 2 bursts/min for neurons having 3 spikes/s and about 4.5 bursts/min for neurons having 30 spikes/s. About 21% of the recorded units emitted significantly fewer bursts than the rest (below 1 burst/1,000 spikes). The percentage of these neurons was independent of spike rate. The spike rate during bursts was found to be about 3-6 times the average spike rate; about the same for longer as for shorter bursts. Bursts typically contained 10-50 spikes and lasted 0.5-2.0 s. When the number of spikes in the successively emitted bursts was listed, it was found that in some neurons these numbers were not distributed at random but were clustered around one or more preferred values. In this sense, bursts occasionally ""recurred"" a few times in a few minutes. The finding suggests that neurons are highly reliable. When bursts of two or more simultaneously recorded neurons were compared, the bursts often appeared to be temporally close, especially between pairs of neurons recorded by the same electrode; but bursts seldom started and ended simultaneously on two channels. Recurring bursts emitted by one neuron were occasionally accompanied by time-locked recurring bursts by other neurons. "

(2003)<jats:italic>Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Hippocampal memory is associative and, to study it more effectively than with previous paradigms, a new learning task is described which is unusual in requiring the incidental encoding of flavour–place paired associates, with the readout of successful storage being successful recall of a place given the flavour with which it was paired. NMDA receptor‐dependent synaptic plasticity is shown to be critical for the encoding and intermediate storage of memory traces in this task, while AMPA receptor‐mediated fast synaptic transmission is necessary for memory retrieval. Typically, these rapidly encoded traces decay quite rapidly over time. Synaptic potentiation also decays rapidly, but can be rendered more persistent by a process of cellular consolidation in which synaptic tagging and capture play a key part in determining whether or not it will be persistent. Synaptic tags set at the time of an event, even many trivial events, can capture the products of the synthesis of plasticity proteins set in train by events before, during or even after an event to be remembered. Tag–protein interactions stabilize synaptic potentiation and, by implication, memory. The behavioural implications of tagging are explored. Finally, using a different protocol for flavour–place paired associate learning, it is shown that rats can develop a spatial schema which represents the relative locations of several different flavours of food hidden at places within a familiar space. This schema is learned gradually but, once acquired, enables new paired associates to be encoded and stored in one trial. Their incorporation into the schema prevents rapid forgetting and suggests that schema play a key and hitherto unappreciated role in systems‐level memory consolidation. The elements of what may eventually mature into a more formal neurobiological theory of hippocampal memory are laid out as specific propositions with detailed conceptual discussion and reference to recent data."

            It is proposed that the most important characteristic of archicortex is its ability to perform a simple kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex. The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation, which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about 200 out of a population of 105 cells. It is shown that if about 10
            <jats:sup>5</jats:sup>
            simple representations are stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the presubiculum, the prosubiculum, the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial number of which must be true if the theory is correct. A general functional classification of typical archicortical cells is proposed.

McGaugh,1966.0,"<jats:p>These observations indicate that the long-lasting trace of an experience is not completely fixed, consolidated, or coded at the time of the experience. Consolidation requires time, and under at least some circumstances the processes of consolidation appear to be susceptible to a variety of influences—both facilitating and impairing—for several hours after the experience. There must be, it seems, more than one kind of memory trace process. If permanent memory traces consolidate slowly over time, then other processes must provide a temporary basis for memory while consolidation is occurring. The evidence clearly indicates that trial-to-trial improvement, or learning, in animals cannot be based completely on permanent memory storage. Amnesia can be produced by electroshock and drugs even if the animals are given the treatment long after they have demonstrated ""learning"" of the task.
          <jats:p>
            Of particular interest is the finding that retention of the inhibitory avoidance response increases with time. In a sense this should be expected, for it has long been known (and ignored) that, within limits, learning is facilitated by increasing the interval between repeated trials. Our result may be the simplest case of such an effect. Since the improvement in retention with time seemed not to be due solely to consolidation (as indicated by electroshock effects), it would seem that the ""distribution of practice"" effect, as it is typically designated, may be due in part to a time-dependent
            <jats:italic>temporary</jats:italic>
            memory storage process. In our work with animals we have found no analog of human immediate memory such as that required for repeating digits (or finishing sentences). Animals tested immediately on the task described above after a trial typically showed no evidence of memory. It could be that the poor performance is due to excessive fright, but the ""distribution of practice effect"" is also typically observed in learning experiments in which food reward is used rather than shock avoidance. Since the retention tasks require the animals to change their behavior in some way, it could well be that the growth of retention over the first few minutes after a trial is due to time-dependent processes involved in the organization of processes necessary for changing behavior, in addition to those involved in temporary storage and retrieval. It is worth pointing out that there is evidence of an analogous process in human memory.
          
          <jats:p>A complex picture of memory storage is emerging. There may be three memory trace systems: one for immediate memory (and not studied in our laboratory); one for short-term memory which develops within a few seconds or minutes and lasts for several hours; and one which consolidates slowly and is relatively permanent. The nature of the durability of the long-term memory trace (that is, the nature and basis of forgetting) is a separate but important issue. There is increasing evidence and speculation that memory storage requires a ""tritrace"" system, and our findings are at least consistent with such a view.
          <jats:p>
            If there are, as seems possible, at least three kinds of traces involved in memory storage, how are they related? Is permanent memory produced by activity of temporary traces, or are the trace systems relatively independent? Although available findings do not provide an answer to this question, there does seem to be increasing evidence that the systems are independent. Acquisition can occur, as we have seen, without permanent consolidation, and both short-term and long-term memory increase with time. All this evidence suggests (but obviously does not prove) that
            <jats:italic>each</jats:italic>
            experience triggers activity in
            <jats:italic>each</jats:italic>
            memory system. Each repeated training trial may, according to this view, potentiate short-term processes underlying acquisition while simultaneously enhancing independent underlying long-term consolidation. Obviously, acceptance of these conclusions will require additional research.
          
          <jats:p>
            If this view is substantially correct, it seems clear that any search for
            <jats:italic>the</jats:italic>
            engram or
            <jats:italic>the</jats:italic>
            basis of memory is not going to be successful. Recognition of the possibility that several independent processes may be involved at different stages of memory may help to organize the search. A careful examination of the time course of retention and memory trace consolidation, as well as examination of the bases of the effects of memory-impairing and memory-facilitating treatments, may help to guide the search. It is clear that a complete theory of memory storage must eventually provide an understanding of time-dependent processes in memory.

On radial arm mazes and similar tasks, place cells are strongly directionally selective within their fields. These tasks differ in several respects, including the visual environment, configuration of the traversable space, motor behavior (e.g., linear and angular velocities), and behavioral context (e.g., presence of specific, consistent goal locations within the environment). The contributions of these factors to spatial and directional tuning of hippocampal neurons was systematically examined in rats performing several tasks in either an enriched or a sparse visual environment, and on different apparati. Place fields were more spatially and directionally selective on a radial maze than on an open, circular platform, regardless of the visual environment. On the platform, fields were more directional when the rat searched for food at fixed locations, in a stereotypic and directed manner, than when the food was scattered randomly. Thus, it seems that place fields are more directional when the animal is planning or following a route between points of special significance. This might be related to the spatial focus of the rat's attention (e.g., a particular reference point). Changing the behavioral task was also accompanied by a change in firing location in about one-third of the cells. Thus, hippocampal neuronal activity appears to encode a complex interaction between locations, their significance and the behaviors the rat is called upon to execute."

Muller; Bruno Poucet,2007.0,"<jats:p>Place cells are hippocampal neurons whose discharge is strongly related to a rat's location in its environment. The existence of place cells has led to the proposal that they are part of an integrated neural system dedicated to spatial navigation, an idea supported by the discovery of strong relationships between place cell activity and spatial problem solving. To further understand such relationships, we examined the discharge of place cells recorded while rats solved a place navigation task. We report that, in addition to having widely distributed firing fields, place cells also discharge selectively while the hungry rat waits in an unmarked goal location to release a food pellet. Such firing is not duplicated in other locations outside the main firing field even when the rat's behavior is constrained to be extremely similar to the behavior at the goal. We therefore propose that place cells provide both a geometric representation of the current environment and a reflection of the rat's expectancy that it is located correctly at the goal. This on-line feedback about a critical aspect of navigational performance is proposed to be signaled by the synchronous activity of the large fraction of place cells active at the goal. In combination with other (prefrontal) cells that provide coarse encoding of goal location, hippocampal place cells may therefore participate in a neural network allowing the rat to plan accurate trajectories in space."

Although many CA1 pyramidal neurons discharge during the time frame (50–100 msec) of each sharp wave, each wave of a ripple (∼5 msec) reflects the synchronization of more discrete subsets of CA1 neurons.<jats:p>When we used multi-site recordings in freely behaving rats, we observed ripples throughout the longitudinal extent (∼4–5 mm) of the dorsal CA1 region that were coherent for multiple cycles of each ripple. High-frequency ripples were also observed throughout the hippocampal–entorhinal output pathway that were concurrent but less coherent on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Single and multiunit neuronal activity was phase-related to local ripples throughout the hippocampal–entorhinal output pathway. Entorhinal ripples occurred 5–30 msec after the CA1 ripples and were related to the occurrence of an entorhinal sharp wave. Thus, during each hippocampal sharp wave, there is a powerful synchronization among the neuronal networks that connect the hippocampus to the neocortex. We suggest that this population interaction (1) biologically constrains theoretical models of hippocampal function and dysfunction and (2) has the capacity to support an “off-line” memory consolidation process."

The mechanism of extracellular current generation in the neocortex was studied in the anesthetized and awake rat. Field potentials and unit activity were recorded simultaneously along trajectories perpendicular to the cortical layers at spatial intervals of 100 μm by multiple-site recording silicon probes. Current source density (CSD) analysis revealed that the spatial positions of sinks in layers IV, V–VI, and II–III and of the accompanying sources were similar during sleep spindles, HVSs, and thalamic-evoked responses, although their relative strengths and timings differed. The magnitude and relative timing of the multiple pairs of sinks and sources determined the amplitude variability of HVSs and sleep spindles. The presence of temporally shifted dipoles was also supported by the time distribution of unit discharges in different layers. Putative interneurons discharged with repetitive bursts of 300–500 Hz. The spike component of HVSs was associated with fast field oscillations (400–600 Hz “ripples”). Discharges of pyramidal cells were phase-locked to the ripples. These findings indicate that the major extracellular currents underlying sleep spindles, HVSs, and evoked responses result from activation of intracortical circuitries. We hypothesize that the fast field ripples reflect summed IPSPs in pyramidal cells resulting from the high frequency barrage of interneurons."

Spindle waves are generated largely through a cyclical interaction between thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons involving both the intrinsic membrane properties of these cells and their anatomical interconnections. Specific alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several different neurotransmitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells, thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is conducive to sensory processing and cognition."

Pairs of units were selected that had nonoverlapping place fields. The rats were restricted from entering the place field of either cell overnight, and on the day of recording cells were exposed to their individual place fields independently and in a counterbalanced manner. Following exposure, recordings were made in the subsequent sleep episodes and the firing characteristics of both cells were analyzed. Following exposure, significant increases in the spiking activity of the exposed cell were observed in the subsequent sleeping states that were not evident in the unexposed cell. The increased activity was observed in the rate of firing (spikes/sec), the rate of occurrence of bursts with multiple spikes, as well as the number of bursts displaying short (2–4 msec) interspike intervals. The findings suggest that neuronal activity of hippocampal place cells in the awake states may influence the firing characteristics of these cells in subsequent sleep episodes. The increased firing rates along with the greater number of multiple spike bursts and the shorter interspike intervals within the burst, following exposure to a cell's place field, may represent possible information processing during sleep."

Barnes,1997.0,"<jats:p>Hippocampal cells that fire together during behaviour exhibit enhanced activity correlations during subsequent sleep, with some preservation of temporal order information. Thus, information reflecting experiences during behaviour is re–expressed in hippocampal circuits during subsequent ‘offline’ periods, as postulated by some theories of memory consolidation. If the hippocampus orchestrates the reinstatement of experience–specific activity patterns in the neocortex, as also postulated by such theories, then correlation patterns both within the neocortex and between hippocampus and neocortex should also re–emerge during sleep. Ensemble recordings were made in the posterior parietal neocortex, in CA1, and simultaneously in both areas, in seven rats. Each session involved an initial sleep episode (S1), behaviour on a simple maze (M), and subsequent sleep (S2). The ensemble activity–correlation structure within and between areas during S2 resembled that of M more closely than did the correlation pattern of S1. Temporal order (i.e. the asymmetry of the cross–correlogram) was also preserved within, but not between, structures. Thus, traces of recent experience are re–expressed in both hippocampal and neocortical circuits during sleep, and the representations in the two areas tend to correspond to the same experience. The poorer preservation of temporal firing biases between neurons in the different regions may reflect the less direct synaptic coupling between regions than within them. Alternatively, it could result from a shift, between behavioural states, in the relative dominance relations in the corticohippocampal dialogue. Between–structure order will be disrupted, for example, if, during behaviour, neocortical patterns tend to drive corresponding hippocampal patterns, whereas during sleep the reverse occurs. This possibility remains to be investigated."

Mulle,1985.0,"<jats:p> The effects of depriving thalamic relay and intralaminar nuclei from their reticularis thalami (RE) inputs were investigated in acute and chronic experiments on cat. In acutely prepared animals, two (frontal and parasagittal) thalamic transections were made; extracellular and intracellular recordings were performed in RE-disconnected thalamic nuclei. In chronic experiments, the RE nuclear complex was lesioned by means of kainic acid injections; the activity of RE-deprived thalamocortical neurons was extracellularly studied during wakefulness and synchronized sleep. Two features distinguish RE-deprived nuclei from normal thalamic nuclei: absence of spindle-wave rhythmicity and all-burst activity of neurons. The abolition of spindle-related rhythms (sequences of 7- to 14-Hz waves recurring periodically with a rhythm of 0.1-0.2 Hz) in RE-disconnected thalamic nuclei and ipsilateral neocortical areas contrasted with normal spindling rhythmicity in contralateral EEG leads. Spontaneously occurring, rhythmic, long-lasting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), as observed in intact preparations, were no longer observed in RE-disconnected thalamic neurons. The remaining inhibitory events consisted of short-duration IPSPs. The possibility that RE nucleus is a pacemaker for spindling rhythms, imposing them through inhibitory projections to target thalamic areas, is supported by our concurrent experiments that indicate RE neurons preserve their rhythmicity after disconnection from their major (cortical and thalamic) input sources. RE-deprived thalamocortical neurons exclusively exhibit high-frequency spike bursts whose intrinsic structure is identical to that of intact thalamic relay cells. Instead of the spindle-related sequences of bursts seen in normal animals, the bursts of RE-disconnected thalamocortical neurons are single events, with a dramatic rhythmicity at 1-2 Hz. The presumed mechanism of this rhythmicity is the periodic activation of a low-threshold somatic conductance whose deinactivation is brought about by temporal integration of short-lasting IPSPs. It is known that high-frequency spike bursts of thalamic relay neurons result from hyperpolarization of cell membrane. We blocked the underlying inhibitory events by bicuculline and reversibly changed the all-burst activity of RE-disconnected neurons into a tonic mode. Since the only activity of RE-deprived thalamocortical neurons consists of burst discharges, we hypothesize that local-circuit GABAergic neurons are released from inhibition after RE disconnection or lesion.

Deschenes,1987.0,"<jats:p> The hypothesis that nucleus reticularis thalami (RE) is the generator of spindle rhythmicity during electroencephalogram (EEG) synchronization was tested in acutely prepared cats. Unit discharges and focal waves were extracellularly recorded in the rostral pole of RE nucleus, which was completely disconnected by transections from all other thalamic nuclei. In some experiments, additional transections through corona radiata created a triangular island in which the rostral RE pole survived with the caudate nucleus, putamen, basal forebrain nuclei, prepyriform area, and the adjacent cortex. Similar results were obtained in two types of experiments: brain stem-transected preparations that exhibited spontaneous spindle sequences, and animals under ketamine anesthesia in which transient spindling was repeatedly precipitated during recording by very low doses of a short-acting barbiturate. Both spindle-related rhythms (7- to 16-Hz waves grouped in sequences that recur with a rhythm of 0.1–0.3 Hz) are seen in focal recordings of the deafferented RE nucleus. The presence of spindling rhythmicity in the disconnected RE nucleus contrasts with total absence of spindles in cortical EEG leads and in thalamic recordings behind the transection. Oscillations within the same frequency range as that of spontaneous spindles can be evoked in the deafferented RE nucleus by subcortical white matter stimulation. In deafferented RE cells, the burst structure consists of an initially biphasic acceleration-deceleration pattern, eventually leading to a long-lasting tonic tail. Quantitative group data show that the burst parameters of disconnected RE cells are very similar to those of RE neurons with intact connections. In the deafferented RE nucleus, spike bursts of RE neurons recur periodically (0.1–0.3 Hz) in close time-relation with simultaneously recorded focal spindle sequences. The burst occurrence of deafferented RE cells is greatly reduced after systemic administration of bicuculline. The preservation of both spindle-related rhythms in the disconnected RE nucleus, together with our recent experiments showing abolition of spindle oscillations in thalamic nuclei after lesions of RE nucleus (24), demonstrate that RE nucleus is the generator of spindle rhythms.

The recorded neurons (n = 254) were antidromically and orthodromically identified as corticothalamic or callosal elements receiving projections from appropriate thalamic nuclei as well as from homotopic foci in the contralateral cortex. Two major types of cells were recorded: regular- spiking (mainly slow-adapting, but also fast-adapting) neurons and intrinsically bursting cells. A group of slowly oscillating neurons (n = 21) were intracellularly stained and found to be pyramidal-shaped cells in layers III-VI, with luxuriant basal dendritic arbors. The slow rhythm appeared in 88% of recorded neurons. It consisted of slow depolarizing envelopes (lasting for 0.8–1.5 sec) with superimposed full action potentials or presumed dendritic spikes, followed by long- lasting hyperpolarizations. Such sequences recurred rhythmically at less than 1 Hz, with a prevailing oscillation between 0.3 and 0.4 Hz in 67% of urethane-anesthetized animals. While in most neurons (approximately 70%) the repetitive spikes superimposed on the slow depolarization were completely blocked by slight DC hyperpolarization, 30% of cells were found to display relatively small (3–12 mV), rapid, all-or-none potentials after obliteration of full action potentials. These fast spikes were suppressed in an all-or-none fashion at Vm more negative than -90 mV. The depolarizing envelope of the slow rhythm was reduced or suppressed at a Vm of -90 to -100 mV and its duration was greatly reduced by administration of the NMDA blocker ketamine. In keeping with this action, most (56%) neurons recorded in animals under ketamine and nitrous oxide or ketamine and xylazine anesthesia displayed the slow oscillation at higher frequencies (0.6–1 Hz) than under urethane anesthesia (0.3–0.4 Hz). In 18% of the oscillating cells, the slow rhythm mainly consisted of repetitive (15–30 Hz), relatively short-lasting (15–25 msec) IPSPs that could be revealed by bringing the Vm at more positive values than -70 mV. The long-lasting (approximately 1 sec) hyperpolarizing phase of the slow oscillation was best observed at the resting Vm and was reduced at about -100 mV. Simultaneous recording of another cell across the membrane demonstrated synchronous inhibitory periods in both neurons. Intracellular diffusion of Cl- or Cs+ reduced the amplitude and/or duration of cyclic long- lasting hyperpolaryzations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Regular-spiking and intrinsically bursting cortical neurons were mostly recorded from association suprasylvian areas 5 and 7; fewer neurons were also recorded from pericruciate motor and posterolateral visual areas. Although most cells were investigated under various anesthetics, a similar slow cortical rhythm was found in animals with brainstem transection at the low- or high-collicular levels. These cerveau isole (isolated forebrain) preparations display the major sleep rhythms of the EEG in the absence of general anesthetics. In 38% of recorded cortical neurons (n = 105), the slow rhythm was combined with delta oscillation. Both cellular rhythms were phase locked to the slow and delta oscillations in the surface- and depth-recorded EEG. In a group of this cell sample (n = 47), delta activity occurred as stereotyped, clock-like action potentials during the interdepolarization lulls of the slow rhythm. In another neuronal subsample (n = 58), delta events were grouped in sequences superimposed upon the depolarizing envelope of the slow rhythm, with such sequences recurring rhythmically at approximately 0.3–0.4 Hz. The associations between the two cellular and EEG rhythms (1–4 Hz and 0.3–0.4 Hz) were quantified by means of autocorrelograms, cross-correlograms, and spike-triggered averages. In 26% of recorded neurons (n = 72), the slow rhythm was combined with spindle oscillations. Regular-spiking cortical neurons fully reflected the whole frequency range of thalamically generated spindles (7–14 Hz). However, during similar patterns of EEG spindling, intrinsically bursting cells fired grouped action potentials (with intraburst frequencies of 100–200 Hz) at only 2–4 Hz. The dependence of the slow cortical oscillation upon the thalamus was studied by lesions and stimulation. The slow rhythm survived extensive ipsilateral thalamic destruction by means of electrolytic lesions or kainate-induced loss of perikarya in thalamic nuclei that were input sources to the recorded cortical neurons. To further prevent the possibility of a thalamic role in the genesis of the slow rhythm, through the contralateral thalamocortical systems and callosal projections, we also transected the corpus callosum in thalamically lesioned animals, and still recorded the slow rhythm in cortical neurons. These data indicate that the thalamus is not essentially implicated in the genesis of the slow rhythm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

We examined the role of such oscillatory synchronization in information transfer between networks in this system. The antennal lobe is the obligatory relay for olfactory afferent signals and generates oscillatory output. The mushroom body is responsible for formation and retrieval of olfactory and other memories. The format of odor representations differs significantly across these structures. Whereas representations are dense, dynamic, and seemingly redundant in the antennal lobe, they are sparse and carried by more selective neurons in the mushroom body. This transformation relies on a combination of oscillatory dynamics and intrinsic and circuit properties that act together to selectively filter and synthesize the output from the antennal lobe. These results provide direct support for the functional relevance of correlation codes and shed some light on the role of oscillatory synchronization in sensory networks."

However, both measures were affected when new sets of neurons were activated in a novel environment. Nevertheless, the grand mean firing rate of the whole pyramidal cell population remained constant across behavioral states and testing conditions.

10.1152/jn.2001.86.1.1,[],0.708252,Impact of Network Activities on Neuronal Properties in Corticothalamic Systems,M. Steriade,2001.0,"<jats:p> Data from in vivo and in vitro experiments are discussed to emphasize that synaptic activities in neocortex and thalamus have a decisive impact on intrinsic neuronal properties in intact-brain preparations under anesthesia and even more so during natural states of vigilance. Thus the firing patterns of cortical neuronal types are not inflexible but may change with the level of membrane potential and during periods rich in synaptic activity. The incidences of some cortical cell classes (defined by their responses to depolarizing current pulses) are different in isolated cortical slabs in vivo or in slices maintained in vitro compared with the intact cortex of naturally awake animals. Network activities, which include the actions of generalized modulatory systems, have a profound influence on the membrane potential, apparent input resistance, and backpropagation of action potentials. The analysis of various oscillatory types leads to the conclusion that in the intact brain, there are no “pure” rhythms, generated in simple circuits, but complex wave sequences (consisting of different, low- and fast-frequency oscillations) that result from synaptic interactions in corticocortical and corticothalamic neuronal loops under the control of activating systems arising in the brain stem core or forebrain structures. As an illustration, it is shown that the neocortex governs the synchronization of network or intrinsically generated oscillations in the thalamus. The rhythmic recurrence of spike bursts and spike trains fired by thalamic and cortical neurons during states of decreased vigilance may lead to plasticity processes in neocortical neurons. If these phenomena, which may contribute to the consolidation of memory traces, are not constrained by inhibitory processes, they induce seizures in which the neocortex initiates the paroxysms and controls their thalamic reflection. The results indicate that intact-brain preparations are necessary to investigate global brain functions such as behavioral states of vigilance and paroxysmal activities. "

In conjunction with sharp wave bursts, CA1 pyramidal cells display a high-frequency (200 Hz) network oscillation (ripple). In the present study extracellular field and unit activity was recorded simultaneously from 16 closely spaces sites in the awake rat and the intracellular activity of CA1 pyramidal cells during the network oscillation was studied under anesthesia. Current source density analysis of the high-frequency oscillation revealed circumscribed sinks and sources in the vicinity of the pyramidal layer. Single pyramidal cells discharged at a low frequency but were phase locked to the negative peak of the locally derived field oscillation. Approximately 10% of the simultaneously recorded pyramidal cells fired during a given oscillatory event. Putative interneurons increased their discharge rates during the field ripples severalfold and often maintained a 200 Hz frequency during the oscillatory event. Under urethane and ketamine anesthesia the frequency of ripples was slower (100–120 Hz) than in the awake rat (180–200 Hz). Halothane anesthesia prevented the occurrence of high-frequency field oscillations in the CA1 region. Both the amplitude (1–4 mV) and phase of the intracellular ripple, but not its frequency, were voltage dependent. The amplitude of intracellular ripple was smallest between -70 and -80 mV. The phase of intracellular oscillation relative to the extracellular ripple reversed when the membrane was hyperpolarized more than -80 mV. A histologically verified CA1 basket cell increased its firing rate during the network oscillation and discharged at the frequency of the extracellular ripple. These findings indicate that the intracellularly recorded fast oscillatory rhythm is not solely dependent on membrane currents intrinsic to the CA1 pyramidal cells but it is a network driven phenomenon dependent upon the participation of inhibitory interneurons. We hypothesize that fast field oscillation (200 Hz) in the CA1 region reflects summed IPSPs in pyramidal cells as a result of high-frequency barrage of interneurons. The sharp wave associated synchronous discharge of pyramidal cells in the millisecond range can exert a powerful influence on retrohippocampal targets and may facilitate the transfer of transiently stored memory traces from the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex."

In visual cortical fields, the time lag between areas 18/19 and 21 neurons was 27.6 +/- 36 ms, between areas 17 and 21 was 36.2 +/- 47.8 ms, and between areas 18/19 and 17 was 40 +/- 73 ms. In the majority of cases, neuronal firing in area 21 preceded that in areas 18/19. The longest time lags were found in distant recordings from visual and motor areas, with a mean of 124 +/- 86.8 ms, although in some cell groups the time intervals between neuronal firing in areas 18/19 or 21 and areas 4 or 6 were as short as approximately 20 ms. 4. Similar time relations were found in those instances in which the unit firing of the same cortical neuron was used as reference in spike triggered averages and was related to the field potential recorded from an adjacent area before impaling a neuron and, thereafter, to membrane potential fluctuations after impaling the cell. 5. The PG reticular thalamic neurons reflected the slow cortical oscillation in 75% of multisite recordings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

Stryker,1993.0,"<jats:p>If vision in one eye is blurred or occluded during a critical period in postnatal development, neurons in the visual cortex lose their responses to stimulation through that eye within a few days. Anatomical changes in the nerve terminals that provide input to the visual cortex have previously been observed only after weeks of deprivation, suggesting that synapses become physiologically ineffective before the branches on which they sit are withdrawn. Reconstruction of single geniculocortical axonal arbors in the cat after either brief or prolonged monocular occlusion revealed striking axonal rearrangements in both instances. Rapid withdrawal of the branches of deprived-eye arbors suggests that axonal branches bearing synapses respond quickly to changing patterns of neuronal activity."

Cantero; Elena Dominguez-Marin,2002.0,"<jats:p>Improvement in perception takes place within the training session and from one session to the next. The present study aims at determining the time course of perceptual learning as revealed by changes in auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting preattentive processes. Subjects were trained to discriminate two complex auditory patterns in a single session. ERPs were recorded just before and after training, while subjects read a book and ignored stimulation. ERPs showed a negative wave called mismatch negativity (MMN)—which indexes automatic detection of a change in a homogeneous auditory sequence—just after subjects learned to consciously discriminate the two patterns. ERPs were recorded again 12, 24, 36, and 48 h later, just before testing performance on the discrimination task. Additional behavioral and neurophysiological changes were found several hours after the training session: an enhanced P2 at 24 h followed by shorter reaction times, and an enhanced MMN at 36 h. These results indicate that gains in performance on the discrimination of two complex auditory patterns are accompanied by different learning-dependent neurophysiological events evolving within different time frames, supporting the hypothesis that fast and slow neural changes underlie the acquisition of improved perception."

Cantero; Robert Stickgold,2004.0,"<jats:p> Perceptual learning can develop over extended periods, with slow, at times sleep-dependent, improvement seen several days after training. As a result, performance can become more automatic, that is, less dependent on voluntary attention. This study investigates whether the brain correlates of this enhancement of automaticity are sleep-dependent. Event-related potentials produced in response to complex auditory stimuli were recorded while subjects' attention was focused elsewhere. We report here that following training on an auditory discrimination task, performance continued to improve, without significant further training, for 72 hr. At the same time, several event-related potential components became evident 48–72 hr after training. Posttraining sleep deprivation prevented neither the continued performance improvement nor the slow development of cortical dynamics related to an enhanced familiarity with the task. However, those brain responses associated with the automatic shift of attention to unexpected stimuli failed to develop. Thus, in this auditory learning paradigm, posttraining sleep appears to reduce the voluntary attentional effort required for successful perceptual discrimination by facilitating the intrusion of a potentially meaningful stimulus into one's focus of attention for further evaluation.

Using subdural and depth recordings from epileptic patients, we now report the first evidence of state-dependent hippocampal θ waves (4-7 Hz) in humans. Unlike the continuous θ in rodents, however, these oscillations were consistently observed during REM sleep in short (∼1 sec) bursts and during transitions to wake in longer epochs. θ waves were also observed in the basal temporal lobe and frontal cortex during transitions from sleep to wake and in quiet wakefulness but not in REM, and they were not coherent with hippocampal θ oscillations. The absence of functional coupling between neocortex and hippocampus during θ periods indicates that multiple θ generators exist in the human brain, and that they are dynamically regulated by brain state. γ oscillations were also present during REM θ bursts, but the fluctuations in γ power were not associated with θ phase, pointing out another significant difference between rodent and human θ properties. Together, these findings suggest that the generation mechanisms of θ oscillations in humans might have evolved from tonic to phasic in hippocampus during REM sleep and extended from hippocampus to cortex, where they appear in certain wakefulness-related states."

Intracellular and computational characterization of the intracortical inhibitory control of synchronized thalamic inputs in vivo. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 335–350, 1997. We investigated the presence and role of local inhibitory cortical control over synchronized thalamic inputs during spindle oscillations (7–14 Hz) by combining intracellular recordings of pyramidal cells in barbiturate-anesthetized cats and computational models. The recordings showed that 1) similar excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)/inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) sequences occurred either during spindles or following thalamic stimulation; 2) reversed IPSPs with chloride-filled pipettes transformed spindle-related EPSP/IPSP sequences into robust bursts with spike inactivation, resembling paroxysmal depolarizing shifts during seizures; and 3) dual simultaneous impalements showed that inhibition associated with synchronized thalamic inputs is local. Computational models were based on reconstructed pyramidal cells constrained by recordings from the same cells. These models showed that the transformation of EPSP/IPSP sequences into fully developed spike bursts critically needs a relatively high density of inhibitory currents in the soma and proximal dendrites. In addition, models predict significant Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>transients in dendrites due to synchronized thalamic inputs.

The form of cortical activity fluctuations and their interactions with sharp waves depend on sleep depth: In deeper sleep stages, characterized by strong neocortical oscillation in the delta range or slower (∼0.8-4 Hz), sharp-wave-triggered peri-event time histograms (PETH) are consistent with a longer duration for down-states than for up-states. In lighter sleep, the sharp-wave-triggered PETH suggested longer up-states than down-states. These results highlight the interplay in the hippocampal/neocortical loop: Decreased neocortical input during down-states may be a factor in generation of sharp waves. In turn, sharp waves may facilitate down-to-up transitions. This interplay may reflect joint memory trace reactivation in the hippocampus and in the neocortex, possibly contributing to consolidation of long-term memory: Off-line reactivation of recent neural activity patterns in the hippocampus occurs during 50-100-msec electroencephalographic sharp waves, corresponding to pyramidal-cell population bursts. The neocortical up-states starting in correspondence with sharp waves may be influenced by the reactivated information carried by the hippocampal sharp wave."

               <jats:p>The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples."

Floresco; Jeremy K. Seamans; Anthony G. Phillips,1997.0,"<jats:p>The hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the ventral striatum form interconnected neural circuits that may underlie aspects of spatial cognition and memory. In the present series of experiments, we investigated functional interactions between these areas in rats during the performance of delayed and nondelayed spatially cued radial-arm maze tasks. The two-phase delayed task consisted of a training phase that provided rats with information about where food would be located on the maze 30 min later during a test phase. The single-phase nondelayed task was identical to the test phase of the delayed task, but in the absence of a training phase rats lacked previous knowledge of the location of food on the maze. Transient inactivation of the ventral CA1/subiculum (vSub) by a bilateral injection of lidocaine disrupted performance on both tasks. Lidocaine injections into the vSub on one side of the brain and the prefrontal cortex on the other transiently disconnected these two brain regions and significantly impaired foraging during the delayed task but not the nondelayed task. Transient disconnections between the vSub and the nucleus accumbens produced the opposite effect, disrupting foraging during the nondelayed task but not during the delayed task. These data suggest that serial transmission of information between the vSub and the prefrontal cortex is required when trial-unique, short-term memory is used to guide prospective search behavior. In contrast, exploratory goal-directed locomotion in a novel situation not requiring previously acquired information about the location of food is dependent on serial transmission between the hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens. These results indicate that different aspects of spatially mediated behavior are subserved by separate, distributed limbic–cortical–striatal networks."

            remains to be understood. Toward this goal, we investigated the influence of the spontaneous, synchronized oscillations in the neocortical local field potential, reflecting up–down states (UDS) of cortical neurons, on the hippocampus. We simultaneously measured the extracellular local field potential in association cortex and the membrane potential of identified hippocampal excitatory neurons in anesthetized mice. Dentate gyrus granule cells showed clear UDS modulation that was phase locked to cortical UDS with a short delay. In contrast, CA3 pyramidal neurons showed mixed UDS modulation, such that some cells were depolarized during the cortical up state and others were hyperpolarized. CA1 pyramidal neurons, located farther downstream, showed consistent UDS modulation, such that when the cortical and dentate gyrus neurons were depolarized, the CA1 pyramidal cells were hyperpolarized. These results demonstrate the differential functional connectivity between neocortex and hippocampal subfields during UDS oscillations.

These modifications were strongly dependent on the behavioral context of the stimuli that induced them.

The importance of these patterns is underscored by the ordered relation of specific neuronal populations to each pattern as well as the relation of each pattern to distinct behavioral states. During awake immobility, consummatory behavior, and slow wave sleep, CA3 and CA1 neurons participate in organized population bursts during SPW. In contrast, during theta-associated exploratory activity, the majority of principle cells are silent. Considerably less is known about the discharge properties of retrohippocampal neurons during theta, and particularly during SPW. These retrohippocampal neurons (entorhinal cortical, parasubicular, presubicular, and subicular) process and transmit information between the neocortex and the hippocampus. The present study examined the activity of these neurons in freely behaving rats during SPW (awake immobility) as well as theta (locomotion and REM sleep). A qualitative distinction between the activity of deep (V-VI) and superficial (II- III) layer retrohippocampal neurons was observed in relation to SPW as compared to theta. Deep layer retrohippocampal neurons exhibited a concurrent increase in activity during hippocampal SPW. In contrast, deep layer neurons were not modulated by the prominent theta oscillations observed throughout the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. On the other hand, superficial layer retrohippocampal neurons were often phase-related to theta oscillations, but were surprisingly indifferent to the SPW-associated population bursting occurring within the deep layers. These findings indicate a concerted discharge of the hippocampal and retrohippocampal cortices during SPW that includes neurons within CA3, CA1, and subiculum as well as neurons in layers V- VI of the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Further, they suggest a temporal discontinuity in the input/output relations between the hippocampus and retrohippocampal structures. We suggest that SPW-associated population bursts in hippocampal and retrohippocampal cortices exert a powerful depolarizing effect on their postsynaptic neocortical targets and may represent a physiological mechanism for memory trace transfer from the hippocampus to the neocortex."

Particular attention has been focused upon long-term potentiation (LTP), a long-lasting, but experimentally induced synaptic change whose physiological properties point to it being a candidate memory mechanism. However, considerations of storage capacity and the possibility of concomitant activity-dependent synaptic depression make it unlikely that individual learning experiences will give rise to gross changes in field potentials similar to those that occur in LTP, even if learning and LTP utilize common neural mechanisms. One way of investigating the functional significance of LTP is to use selective antagonists of those excitatory amino acid receptors whose activation is essential for its induction. This paper discusses various design requirements for such experiments and reviews work indicating that the<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist AP5 causes a behaviourally selective learning impairment having certain common features to the behavioural profile seen after hippocampal lesions. Two new studies are described whose results show that AP5 has no effect upon the retrieval of previously established memories, and that the dose—response profile of the impairment of spatial learning occurs across a range of extracellular concentrations in hippocampus for which receptor selectivity exists. These experiments show that activation of NMDA receptors is essential for certain kinds of learning."

Confidence limits are based on these expected numbers of patterns, so that is possible to identify groups of patterns that are worthy of further analysis. 4. These methods are tested against simulated multineuron data that has various types of known nonstationarities, with good agreement between observed and expected values. 5. Application to real spike trains shows a large excess of observed repeating patterns, of which some, but not all, are shown to be due to bursts of high frequency firing. 6. It should be possible to apply the new method as a filter in real time in order to search for an association between repeated pattern events and externally observable events (stimulus, behavior, etc.). Any repeated pattern events which cannot be so associated may represent a new indicator of internal events in the nervous system. "

Activity of up to 10 single units was recorded in parallel from frontal areas of behaving monkeys. 2. Spatiotemporal firing patterns were revealed by a method that detects all excessively repeating patterns regardless of their complexity or single-unit composition. 3. Excess of repeating patterns was found in 30-60% of the cases examined when timing jitter of 1-3 ms was allowed. 4. An independent test refuted the hypothesis that these patterns represented chance events. 5. In a given behavioral condition there were usually many different patterns, each repeating several times, and not one (or a few) pattern repeating many times. 6. In 13 out of 20 cases, when a single unit elevated its firing rate in association with an external event beyond 40/s, most of the spikes within that period were associated with excessively repeating spatiotemporal patterns. 7. Of 157 types of patterns whose excess was most marked, 107 were composed of spikes from one single unit, 45 of the patterns contained spikes from two single units, and only one was composed of spikes from three different single units. 8. These properties suggest that the patterns were generated by reverberations in a synfire mode within self-exciting cell assemblies. "

The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb’s rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification."

Sequential firing of place cells during exploration induces, in the model, a pattern of LTP between place cells that shifts the location coded by their ensemble activity away from the actual location of the animal. These shifts provide a navigational map that, in a simulation of the Morris maze, can guide the animal toward its goal. The model demonstrates how behaviorally generated modifications of synaptic strengths can be read out to affect subsequent behavior. Our results also suggest a way that navigational maps can be constructed from experimental recordings of hippocampal place cells. "

Dave; Daniel Margoliash,2000.0,"<jats:p>Songbirds learn a correspondence between vocal-motor output and auditory feedback during development. For neurons in a motor cortex analog of adult zebra finches, we show that the timing and structure of activity elicited by the playback of song during sleep matches activity during daytime singing. The motor activity leads syllables, and the matching sensory response depends on a sequence of typically up to three of the preceding syllables. Thus, sensorimotor correspondence is reflected in temporally precise activity patterns of single neurons that use long sensory memories to predict syllable sequences. Additionally, “spontaneous” activity of these neurons during sleep matches their sensorimotor activity, a form of song “replay.” These data suggest a model whereby sensorimotor correspondences are stored during singing but do not modify behavior, and off-line comparison (e.g., during sleep) of rehearsed motor output and predicted sensory feedback is used to adaptively shape motor output."

Intracellularly recorded EPSPs resulting from single- volley stimulation at low frequency (0.15–0.1 Hz) in the stratum radiatum or oriens were paired with depolarizing current pulses (50–100 msec) injected through the recording microelectrode. It is shown that these EPSPs, when paired with pulses of sufficient magnitude, become potentiated. This potentiation generally reached a peak after 20–30 pairing events and could outlast the conditioning period by more than 1 hr. It was specific to the paired input, was blocked by 2-amino-5- phosphonovalerate (APV) and was largely blocked by prior homosynaptic tetanization (and vice versa). In experiments performed with picrotoxin (PTX) in the bath, EPSPs were potentiated using 2–4 nA current pulses, with somewhat higher values in normal solution. The effective current pulses, in both normal and PTX solution, produced a repetitive spike discharge of 7–11 spikes (per 100 msec), and within this range, higher frequencies were associated with larger potentiations. However, since similar degrees of EPSP potentiation were observed following blockade of spike activity by intracellular QX-314, spike activity was not the primary conditioning factor. For the potentiation to appear, the EPSP had to occur together with the current pulse or precede it by less than about 100 msec. No potentiation was observed when the EPSP immediately succeeded the pulse. The results suggest that the cooperativity aspect of LTP is related to a need for sufficient postsynaptic depolarization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

McNaughton,1999.0,"<jats:p>During slow wave sleep (SWS), traces of neuronal activity patterns from preceding behavior can be observed in rat hippocampus and neocortex. The spontaneous reactivation of these patterns is manifested as the reinstatement of the distribution of pairwise firing-rate correlations within a population of simultaneously recorded neurons. The effects of behavioral state [quiet wakefulness, SWS, and rapid eye movement (REM)], interactions between two successive spatial experiences, and global modulation during 200 Hz electroencephalographic (EEG) “ripples” on pattern reinstatement were studied in CA1 pyramidal cell population recordings. Pairwise firing-rate correlations during often repeated experiences accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in these interactions in subsequent SWS or quiet wakefulness and, to a lesser degree, during SWS before the experience on a given day. The latter effect was absent for novel experiences, suggesting that a persistent memory trace develops with experience. Pattern reinstatement was strongest during sharp wave–ripple oscillations, suggesting that these events may reflect system convergence onto attractor states corresponding to previous experiences. When two different experiences occurred in succession, the statistically independent effects of both were evident in subsequent SWS. Thus, the patterns of neural activity reemerge spontaneously, and in an interleaved manner, and do not necessarily reflect persistence of an active memory (i.e., reverberation). Firing-rate correlations during REM sleep were not related to the preceding familiar experience, possibly as a consequence of trace decay during the intervening SWS. REM episodes also did not detectably influence the correlation structure in subsequent SWS, suggesting a lack of strengthening of memory traces during REM sleep, at least in the case of familiar experiences."

In dual whole-cell voltage recordings from pyramidal neurons, the coincidence of postsynaptic action potentials (APs) and unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) was found to induce changes in EPSPs. Their average amplitudes were differentially up- or down-regulated, depending on the precise timing of postsynaptic APs relative to EPSPs. These observations suggest that APs propagating back into dendrites serve to modify single active synaptic connections, depending on the pattern of electrical activity in the pre- and postsynaptic neurons."

A maximum of six 60 sec scans were performed per subject during periods of wakefulness and stages 1–4 of SWS, as determined by on-line EEG monitoring. Spectral analysis was performed off-line on the EEG epochs corresponding to the scans for computation of activity in specific frequency bands. The relationship between EEG frequency band activity and normalized rCBF was determined by means of a voxel-by-voxel analysis of covariance. δ activity covaried negatively with rCBF most markedly in the thalamus and also in the brainstem reticular formation, cerebellum, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex. After the effect of δ was removed, a significant negative covariation between spindle activity and the residual rCBF was evident in the medial thalamus. These negative covariations may reflect the disfacilitation and active inhibition of thalamocortical relay neurons in association with δ and spindles, as well as the neural substrates underlying the progressive attenuation of sensory awareness, motor responsiveness, and arousal that occur during SWS. δ activity covaried positively with rCBF in the visual and auditory cortex, possibly reflecting processes of dream-like mentation purported to occur during SWS."

Long-term memory storage within some of these neocortical regions was accompanied by structural changes including synaptogenesis and laminar reorganization, concomitant with a functional disengagement of the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortices. Thus, consolidation of spatial memory requires a time-dependent hippocampal-cortical dialogue, ultimately enabling widespread cortical networks to mediate effortful recall and use of cortically stored remote memories independently."

We recorded sleep for 3 h after rats were trained on an odor-reward association task. Learning resulted in an increased number SPW-Rs during the first hour of post-learning SWS. The magnitude of ripple events and their duration were also elevated for up to 2 h after the newly formed memory. Rats that did not learn the discrimination during the training session did not show any change in SPW-Rs. Successful retrieval from remote memory was likewise accompanied by an increase in SPW-R density and magnitude, relative to the previously recorded baseline, but the effects were much shorter lasting and did not include increases in ripple duration and amplitude. A short-lasting increase of ripple activity was also observed when rats were rewarded for performing a motor component of the task only. There were no increases in ripple activity after habituation to the experimental environment. These experiments show that the characteristics of hippocampal high-frequency oscillations during SWS are affected by prior behavioral experience. Associative learning induces robust and sustained (up to 2 h) changes in several SPW-R characteristics, while after retrieval from remote memory or performance of a well-trained procedural aspect of the task, only transient changes in ripple density were induced."

Whereas the neuronal basis of recognition memory can be probed experimentally in human and nonhuman primates, the study of free recall requires that the mind declare the occurrence of a recalled memory (an event intrinsic to the organism and invisible to an observer). Here, we report the activity of single neurons in the human hippocampus and surrounding areas when subjects first view cinematic episodes consisting of audiovisual sequences and again later when they freely recall these episodes. A subset of these neurons exhibited selective firing, which often persisted throughout and following specific episodes for as long as 12 seconds. Verbal reports of memories of these specific episodes at the time of free recall were preceded by selective reactivation of the same hippocampal and entorhinal cortex neurons. We suggest that this reactivation is an internally generated neuronal correlate for the subjective experience of spontaneous emergence of human recollection."

The transitions between these states, at once rapid and drastic, remain poorly understood. Here, intracranial local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus were used to characterize the neurophysiological correlates of the rat wake-sleep cycle. By way of a new method for the objective classification and quantitative investigation of all major brain states, we demonstrate that global brain state transitions occur simultaneously across multiple forebrain areas as specific spectral trajectories with characteristic path, duration, and coherence bandwidth. During state transitions, striking changes in neural synchronization are effected by the prominent narrow-band LFP oscillations that mark state boundaries. Our results demonstrate that distant forebrain areas tightly coordinate the processing of neural information during and between global brain states, indicating a very high degree of functional integration across the entire wake-sleep cycle. We propose that transient oscillatory synchronization of synaptic inputs, which underlie the rapid switching of global brain states, may facilitate the exchange of information within and across brain areas at the boundaries of very distinct neural processing regimens."

well established. Although there is little doubt that its anatomical
subregions—the hippocampus, peri-, entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex
(PHC)—contribute differentially to mnemonic processes, their specific
functions in episodic memory are under debate. Data from animal, human lesion,
and neuroimaging studies suggest somewhat contradictory perspectives on this
functional specialization: a general participation in declarative memory, an
exclusive involvement in associative mnemonic processes, and a specific
contribution to spatial memory are reported for the hippocampus, adjacent
cortices, and the PHC. A functional lateralization in humans dependent on the
verbalizability of the material is also discussed herein. To further elucidate
the differential contributions of the various MTL subregions to encoding, we
employed an object-location association memory paradigm. The memory for each
of the studied associations was tested twice: by the object, and by the
location serving as retrieval cue. The memory accuracy in response to both cue
types was also assessed parametrically. Brain activity during encoding which
leads to different degrees of subsequent memory accuracy under the two
retrieval conditions was compared. We found the bilateral posterior PHC to
participate in encoding of both the object associated with a location and the
location associated with an object. In contrast, activity in an area in the
left anterior PHC and the right anterior MTL was only correlated with the
memory for the location associated with an object."

Reconsolidation has been observed in human procedural memory and in implicit memory in infants. This study asks whether episodic memory undergoes reconsolidation. College students learned a list of objects on Day 1. On Day 2, they received a reminder or not, and then learned a second list. Memory for List 1 was tested immediately on Day 2 (Experiment 2) or on Day 3 (Experiment 1). Although the reminder did not moderate the number of items recalled from List 1 on either day, subjects who received a reminder incorrectly intermixed items from the second list when recalling List 1 on Day 3. Experiment 2 showed that this effect does not occur immediately and thus is time-dependent. The reminder did not affect memory for List 2 on Day 3 (Experiment 3), demonstrating that modification occurred only for the original memory (List 1). The study demonstrates the crucial role of reminders for the modification of episodic memory, that reconsolidation of episodic memory is time-dependent, and, in contrast to previous reconsolidation findings, that reconsolidation is also a constructive process, one that supports the incorporation of new information in memory."

The phenomenon has been demonstrated in very diverse species and types of memory, including the human procedural memory of a motor skill task but not the human declarative one. Here we provide evidence for both consolidation and reconsolidation in a paired-associate learning (i.e., learning an association between a cue syllable and the respective response syllable). Subjects were given two training sessions with a 24-h interval on distinct verbal material, and afterward, they received at testing two successive retrievals corresponding to the first and second learning, respectively. Two main results are noted. First, the first acquired memory was impaired when a reminder was presented 5 min before the second training (reconsolidation), and also when the second training was given 5 min instead of 24 h after the first one (consolidation). Second, the first retrieval proved to influence negatively on the later one (the retrieval-induced forgetting [RIF] effect), and we used the absence of this RIF effect as a very indicator of the target memory impairment. We consider the demonstration of reconsolidation in human declarative memory as backing the universality of this phenomenon and having potential clinical relevance. On the other hand, we discuss the possibility of using the human declarative memory as a model to address several key topics of the reconsolidation hypothesis."

Brown; Loren M. Frank; Dengda Tang; Michael C. Quirk; Matthew A. Wilson,1998.0,"<jats:p>The problem of predicting the position of a freely foraging rat based on the ensemble firing patterns of place cells recorded from the CA1 region of its hippocampus is used to develop a two-stage statistical paradigm for neural spike train decoding. In the first, or encoding stage, place cell spiking activity is modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process whose instantaneous rate is a function of the animal’s position in space and phase of its theta rhythm. The animal’s path is modeled as a Gaussian random walk. In the second, or decoding stage, a Bayesian statistical paradigm is used to derive a nonlinear recursive causal filter algorithm for predicting the position of the animal from the place cell ensemble firing patterns. The algebra of the decoding algorithm defines an explicit map of the discrete spike trains into the position prediction. The confidence regions for the position predictions quantify spike train information in terms of the most probable locations of the animal given the ensemble firing pattern. Under our inhomogeneous Poisson model position was a three to five times stronger modulator of the place cell spiking activity than theta phase in an open circular environment. For animal 1 (2) the median decoding error based on 34 (33) place cells recorded during 10 min of foraging was 8.0 (7.7) cm. Our statistical paradigm provides a reliable approach for quantifying the spatial information in the ensemble place cell firing patterns and defines a generally applicable framework for studying information encoding in neural systems."

Superficial layers receive convergent cortical information, which is relayed to structures in the hippocampus, and hippocampal output reaches deep layers of entorhinal cortex, that project back to the cortex. The finding of the grid cells in all layers and reports on interactions between deep and superficial layers indicate that this rather simplistic perception may be at fault. Therefore, an integrative approach on the entorhinal cortex, that takes into account recent additions to our knowledge database on entorhinal connectivity, is timely. We argue that layers in entorhinal cortex show different functional characteristics most likely not on the basis of strikingly different inputs or outputs, but much more likely on the basis of differences in intrinsic organization, combined with very specific sets of inputs. Here, we aim to summarize recent anatomical data supporting the notion that the traditional description of the entorhinal cortex as a layered input-output structure for the hippocampal formation does not give the deserved credit to what this structure might be contributing to the overall functions of cortico-hippocampal networks."

We have found similar reverse‐order reactivation during SWRs in open‐field exploration where the firing sequence of cells varied before each SWR. Both the onset times and the firing patterns of cells showed a tendency for reversed sequences during SWRs. These effects were observed for SWRs that occurred during exploration, but not for those during longer immobility periods. Additionally, reverse reactivation was stronger when it was preceded by higher speed (&gt; 5 cm/s) run periods. The trend for reverse‐order SWR reactivation was not significantly different in familiar and novel environments, even though SWR‐associated firing rates of both pyramidal cells and interneurons were reduced in novel environments as compared with familiar. During exploration‐associated SWRs (eSWR) place cells retain place‐selective firing [O'Neill <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> (2006) <jats:italic>Neuron</jats:italic>, 49, 143–155]. Here, we have shown that each cell's firing onset was more delayed and firing probability more reduced during eSWRs the further the rat was from the middle of the cell's place field; that is, cells receiving less momentary place‐related excitatory drive fired later during SWR events. However, even controlling for place field distance, the recent firing of cells was still significantly correlated with SWR reactivation sequences. We therefore propose that both place‐related drive and the firing history of cells contribute to reverse reactivation during eSWRs."

Although the properties of place cells are a basis for understanding the mammalian representation of spatial knowledge, there is no consensus on which of the two fundamental neural-coding hypotheses correctly accounts for how place cells encode spatial information. Within the dedicated-coding hypothesis, the current activity of each cell is an independent estimate of the location with respect to its place field. The average of the location estimates from many cells represents current location, so a dedicated place code would degrade if single cells had multiple place fields. Within the alternative, ensemble-coding hypothesis, the concurrent discharge of many place cells is a vector that represents current location. An ensemble place code is not degraded if single cells have multiple place fields as long as the discharge vector at each location is unique. Place cells with multiple place fields might be required to represent the substantially larger space in more natural environments. To distinguish between the dedicated-coding and ensemble-coding hypotheses, we compared the characteristics of CA1 place fields in a standard cylinder and an approximately six times larger chamber. Compared with the cylinder, in the chamber, more CA1 neurons were place cells, each with multiple, irregularly arranged, and enlarged place fields. The results indicate that multiple place fields is a fundamental feature of CA1 place cell activity and that, consequently, an ensemble place code is required for CA1 discharge to accurately signal location."

Wilson,2007.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The activity of individual hippocampal principal neurons is spatially localized such that each neuron is active only when the animal occupies an area of the environment known as the cell's place field. Additionally, the activity of hippocampal neurons exhibits a particular temporal relationship to the hippocampal EEG, such that spikes fired by the neuron occur at progressively earlier phases of the co‐occurring theta rhythm in the EEG as the animal traverses the place field. This relationship is known as theta precession. A long‐standing prediction following the observation of theta precession has been that among a collection of hippocampal neurons recorded simultaneously, the neurons will fire in sequences reflecting the behavioral order of the place fields. Here we examine this prediction. We show that clear, ordered sequences occur during theta, which we name theta sequences, in which a portion of the animal's spatial experience is played out in forwards order. We further investigate the relationship of theta sequences to phase precession by shuffling spike phases in such a way as to preserve the relationship between spike phase and position. This jitter significantly reduces the prevalence of theta sequences while leaving theta phase precession intact, suggesting that the presence of theta phase precession is not trivially predictive of theta sequences. Finally, we discuss the relationship between theta sequences and individual place fields, and the possible functional role of theta sequences in navigational learning. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."

Examination of neural representations of space at fast time scales revealed a transient but repeatable phenomenon as rats made a decision: the location reconstructed from the neural ensemble swept forward, first down one path and then the other. Estimated representations were coherent and preferentially swept ahead of the animal rather than behind the animal, implying it represented future possibilities rather than recently traveled paths. Similar phenomena occurred at other important decisions (such as in recovery from an error). Local field potentials from these sites contained pronounced theta and gamma frequencies, but no sharp wave frequencies. Forward-shifted spatial representations were influenced by task demands and experience. These data suggest that the hippocampus does not represent space as a passive computation, but rather that hippocampal spatial processing is an active process likely regulated by cognitive mechanisms."

The notion of bidirectional connections between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal formation have led to the suggestion that hippocampal output originating in CA1 and subiculum may reenter hippocampal subfields via the entorhinal cortex. To investigate this, we used simultaneous multi‐site field potential recordings and current source density analysis in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampal formation of the rat in vivo. Under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, we found that repetitive stimulation of subiculum or Schaffer collaterals facilitated entorhinal responses, such that a population spike appeared in layer III. In addition, a current sink in stratum lacunosum‐moleculare of area CA1 was found, that followed responses in the entorhinal cortex, indicating reentrance into this area. Responses indicating reentrance in the dentate gyrus were not found under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, but were readily evoked under urethane anesthesia. Reentrance into CA1 was also encountered under urethane anesthesia. These results suggest that parallel, but possibly functionally distinct, connections are present between the output of the hippocampal formation and cells in layers III and II of the entorhinal cortex that project to area CA1 and the dentate gyrus, respectively. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."

Blair; Adam C. Welday; Kechen Zhang,2007.0,"<jats:p>The dorsomedial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) of the rat brain contains a remarkable population of spatially tuned neurons called grid cells (Hafting et al., 2005). Each grid cell fires selectively at multiple spatial locations, which are geometrically arranged to form a hexagonal lattice that tiles the surface of the rat's environment. Here, we show that grid fields can combine with one another to form moiré interference patterns, referred to as “moiré grids,” that replicate the hexagonal lattice over an infinite range of spatial scales. We propose that dMEC grids are actually moiré grids formed by interference between much smaller “theta grids,” which are hypothesized to be the primary source of movement-related theta rhythm in the rat brain. The formation of moiré grids from theta grids obeys two scaling laws, referred to as the length and rotational scaling rules. The length scaling rule appears to account for firing properties of grid cells in layer II of dMEC, whereas the rotational scaling rule can better explain properties of layer III grid cells. Moiré grids built from theta grids can be combined to form yet larger grids and can also be used as basis functions to construct memory representations of spatial locations (place cells) or visual images. Memory representations built from moiré grids are automatically endowed with size invariance by the scaling properties of the moiré grids. We therefore propose that moiré interference between grid fields may constitute an important principle of neural computation underlying the construction of scale-invariant memory representations."

The current study sought to extend previous research in this area by examining the effect of substituting a new stimulus for a familiar stimulus in a familiar environment. Hippocampal place cells were recorded while rats chased food pellets scattered onto the floor of a cylindrical apparatus with a white cue card affixed to the apparatus wall. Once a place cell had been recorded in the presence of the white card, the white card was replaced by a black card of the same size and shape. The place cell was then recorded in the presence of the black card. Thirty‐six cells were recorded using this procedure. All cells had stable firing fields in the presence of the white card. Both the white and black cards had stimulus control over place cell firing; generally, rotation of either card caused an equal rotation of the firing fields present. When the black card was substituted for the white card, place cells showed time‐variant changes in their spatial firing patterns. The change was such that the spatial firing patterns of the majority of place cells were similar in the presence of the white and black cards during initial black card exposures. During subsequent presentations of the black card, the spatial firing patterns associated with the 2 cards became distinct from each other. Once the differentiation of firing patterns had occurred in a given rat, all place cells subsequently recorded from that rat had different firing patterns in the presence of the white and black cards. The findings are discussed relative to sensory‐, motor‐, attentional‐, and learning‐related interpretations of hippocampal function. It is argued that the time‐variant alteration of place cell firing fields observed following exposure to a novel stimulus in this study reflects an experience‐dependent modification of place cell firing patterns."

Specifically, dendritic subunits of layer II medial entorhinal stellate cells provide multiple linear interference patterns along different directions, with their product determining the firing of the cell. Connection of appropriate speed‐ and direction‐ dependent inputs onto dendritic subunits could result from an unsupervised learning rule which maximizes postsynaptic firing (e.g. competitive learning). These inputs cause the intrinsic oscillation of subunit membrane potential to increase above theta frequency by an amount proportional to the animal's speed of running in the “preferred” direction. The phase difference between this oscillation and a somatic input at theta‐frequency essentially integrates velocity so that the interference of the two oscillations reflects distance traveled in the preferred direction. The overall grid pattern is maintained in environmental location by phase reset of the grid cell by place cells receiving sensory input from the environment, and environmental boundaries in particular. We also outline possible variations on the basic model, including the generation of grid‐like firing via the interaction of multiple cells rather than via multiple dendritic subunits. Predictions of the interference model are given for the frequency composition of EEG power spectra and temporal autocorrelograms of grid cell firing as functions of the speed and direction of running and the novelty of the environment. © 2007 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."

Maxwell Cowan,1986.0,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The axon collaterals of dentate granule cells have been analyzed with the aid of a computerized microscope, following intracellular injections of horseradish peroxidase in hippocampal slice preparations. The axon of each granule cell gives rise to approximately seven primary collaterals; these collaterals usually divide into secondary and tertiary branches, which form an extensive plexus within the hilar region of the dentate gyrus. Individual axon collaterals vary greatly in length, but most have been found to be between 100 and 300 μm long. On average, the summed lengths of the collaterals (exclusive of the parent mossy fiber) are approximately 2,300 μm. Except for an occasional collateral that is given off by a mossy fiber in the proximal part of field CA<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> of the hippocampus, the collaterals of the granule cell axons are confined to the hilar region; they are rarely seen in the granule cell layer itself and have never been observed in the molecular layer. In the longitudinal dimension of the dentate gyros, most of the collaterals are contained within a zone about 400 μm wide. The distribution of the collaterals within the hilar region is correlated with the location of the granule cell body. Those that arise from cells near the tip of the suprapyramidal blade tend to be confined to the region above field CA<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>; those from cells nearer the crest and from the infrapyramidal blade ramify widely throughout the hilus.<jats:p>Two types of varicosities are present on the collaterals.

The second type of varicosity is irregular in shape and ranges from 2 to 4 μm in diameter; there is usually only one sucil varicosity per collateral.

Nongeometric information may allow the discrimination of different spatial contexts. Understanding how nongeometric (or contextual) information affects hippocampal activity is important in light of proposals that the hippocampus may play a role in constructing a representation of spatial context. We investigated the contextual modulation of place cell activity by recording hippocampal place cells while rats foraged in compound contexts comprising black or white color paired with lemon or vanilla odor. Some cells responded to the color or odor changes alone, but most responded to varying combinations of both. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, that there is a heterogeneous input by contextual inputs into the hippocampus. We propose a model of contextual remapping of place cells in which the geometric inputs are selectively activated by subsets of contextual stimuli. Because it appears that different place cells are affected by different subsets of contextual stimuli, the representation of the entire context would require activity at the population level, supporting a role for the hippocampus in constructing a representation of spatial context."

Weisz; R. F. Thompson,1983.0,"<jats:p> Extracellular single-unit recordings from neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the dorsal hippocampus were monitored during classical conditioning of the rabbit nictitating membrane response. Neurons were classified as different cell types using response to fornix stimulation (i.e., antidromic or orthodromic activation) and spontaneous firing characteristics as criteria. Results showed that hippocampal pyramidal neurons exhibit learning-related neural plasticity that develops gradually over the course of classical conditioning. The learning-dependent pyramidal cell response is characterized by an increase in frequency of firing within conditioning trials and a within-trial pattern of discharge that correlates strongly with amplitude-time course of the behavioral response. In contrast, pyramidal cell activity recorded from control animals given unpaired presentations of the conditioned and unconditioned stimulus (CS and UCS) does not show enhanced discharge rates with repeated stimulation. Previous studies of hippocampal cellular electrophysiology have described what has been termed a theta-cell (19-21, 45), the activity of which correlates with slow-wave theta rhythm generated in the hippocampus. Neurons classified as theta-cells in the present study exhibit responses during conditioning that are distinctly different than pyramidal cells. theta-Cells respond during paired conditioning trials with a rhythmic bursting; the between-burst interval occurs at or near 8 Hz. In addition, two different types of theta-cells were distinguishable. One type of theta-cell increases firing frequency above pretrial levels while displaying the theta bursting pattern. The other type decreases firing frequency below pretrial rates while showing a theta-locked discharge. In addition to pyramidal and theta-neurons, several other cell types recorded in or near the pyramidal cell layer could be distinguished. One cell type was distinctive in that it could be activated with a short, invariant latency following fornix stimulation, but spontaneous action potentials of such neurons could not be collided with fornix shock-induced action potentials. These neurons exhibit a different profile of spontaneous firing characteristics than those of antidromically identified pyramidal cells. Nevertheless, neurons in this noncollidable category display the same learning-dependent response as pyramidal cells. It is suggested that the noncollidable neurons represent a subpopulation of pyramidal cells that do not project an axon via the fornix but project, instead, to other limbic cortical regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

Only rarely was the stimulus dependence of individual neuron discharges sufficient to account for the discrimination performance of the ferrets. In contrast, when analyzed with a simple classifier, responses of small ensembles, comprising 3-61 simultaneously recorded neurons, often discriminated periodicity changes as well as the animals did. We examined four potential strategies for decoding ensemble responses: spike counts, relative first-spike latencies, a binary “spike or no-spike” code, and a spike-order code. All four codes represented stimulus periodicity effectively, and, surprisingly, the spike count and relative latency codes enabled an equally rapid readout, within 75 ms of stimulus onset. Thus, relative latency codes do not necessarily facilitate faster discrimination judgments. A joint spike count plus relative latency code was more informative than either code alone, indicating that the information captured by each measure was not wholly redundant.

Indeed, recent studies support the existence of anatomically segregated “what” and “where” cortical processing streams. However, few attempts have been made to measure the responses of individual neurons in different cortical fields to sounds that vary simultaneously across spatial and nonspatial dimensions. We recorded responses to artificial vowels presented in virtual acoustic space to investigate the representations of pitch, timbre, and sound source azimuth in both core and belt areas of ferret auditory cortex. A variance decomposition technique was used to quantify the way in which altering each parameter changed neural responses. Most units were sensitive to two or more of these stimulus attributes. Although indicating that neural encoding of pitch, location, and timbre cues is distributed across auditory cortex, significant differences in average neuronal sensitivity were observed across cortical areas and depths, which could form the basis for the segregation of spatial and nonspatial cues at higher cortical levels. Some units exhibited significant nonlinear interactions between particular combinations of pitch, timbre, and azimuth. These interactions were most pronounced for pitch and timbre and were less commonly observed between spatial and nonspatial attributes. Such nonlinearities were most prevalent in primary auditory cortex, although they tended to be small compared with stimulus main effects."

The sound levels of the vowels were randomly changed from trial to trial over a 10-dB range. The animals easily transferred the training to a new set of vowels produced by 24 new talkers. Subsequently, the animals similarly transferred to synthetic ‖a‖’s and ‖i‖’s. The only relevant difference between the synthetic vowels was their formant structure, while there were irrelevant differences in their pitch contours. We conclude that the chinchilla can abstract some essential difference(s) between sustained ‖a‖ and ‖i‖ and ignore irrelevant variations of sound level, pitch level, pitch contour, and voice quality. These results are discussed in terms of perceptual learning and auditory concept formation.

The temporal discharge patterns of auditory nerve fibers in Dial-anesthetized cats were studied in response to periodic complex acoustic waveforms that evoke pitches at their fundamental frequencies. Single-formant vowels, amplitude-modulated (AM) and quasi-frequency-modulated tones. AM noise, click trains, and other complex tones were utilized. Distributions of intervals between successive spikes (""1st-order intervals"") and between both successive and nonsuccessive spikes (""all-order intervals"") were computed from spike trains. Intervals from many fibers were pooled to estimate interspike interval distributions for the entire auditory nerve. Properties of these ""pooled interspike interval distributions,"" such as the positions of interval peaks and their relative heights, were examined for correspondence to the psychophysical data on pitch frequency and pitch salience. 2. For a diverse set of complex stimuli and levels, the most frequent all-order interspike interval present in the pooled distribution corresponded to the pitch heard in psychophysical experiments. Pitch estimates based on pooled interval distributions (30-85 fibers, 100 stimulus presentations per fiber) were highly accurate (within 1%) for harmonic stimuli that produce strong pitches at 60 dB SPL. 3. Although the most frequent intervals in pooled all-order interval distributions were very stable with respect to sound intensity level (40, 60, and 80 dB total SPL), this was not necessarily the case for first-order interval distributions. Because the low pitches of complex tones are largely invariant with respect to level, pitches estimated from all-order interval distributions correspond better to perception. 4. Spectrally diverse stimuli that evoke similar low pitches produce pooled interval distributions with similar most-frequent intervals. This suggests that the pitch equivalence of these different stimuli could result from central auditory processing mechanisms that analyze interspike interval patterns. 5. Complex stimuli that evoke strong or ""salient"" pitches produce pooled interval distributions with high peak-to-mean ratios. Those stimuli that evoke weak pitches produce pooled interval distributions with low peak-to-mean ratios. 6. Pooled interspike interval distributions for stimuli consisting of low-frequency components generally resembled the short-time auto-correlation function of stimulus waveforms. Pooled interval distributions for stimuli consisting of high-frequency components resembled the short-time autocorrelation function of the waveform envelope. 7. Interval distributions in populations of neurons constitute a general, distributed means of encoding, transmitting, and representing information. Existence of a central processor capable of analyzing these interval patterns could provide a unified explanation for many different aspects of pitch perception. "

Deadwyler,1986.0,"<jats:p> Extracellular recordings of individual hippocampal neurons in behaving rats were classified by several different electrophysiological criteria as theta (theta-) or complex spike cells. The firing characteristics of each cell were studied in two different behavioral contexts, each of which contained experimental conditions in which firing correlates of these cells have been demonstrated previously. Forty-eight theta-cells and 68 complex spike cells were classified and studied electrophysiologically as animals performed an operant auditory discrimination task or freely explored an open platform environment for water reward. Spontaneous discharge characteristics, as well as electrically evoked firing patterns following stimulation of hippocampal fiber pathways, consistently differentiated theta-cells from complex spike cells. In agreement with previous reports, these results indicate that theta-cells and complex spike cells represent electrophysiologically and possibly morphologically different types of hippocampal neurons. A clear dichotomy also emerged between the firing correlates of identified theta-cells and complex spike cells in the two behavioral tests. During auditory-discrimination learning and performance, time-locked theta-cell discharges to tone onset were correlated with the emergence of conditioned behavioral responding. Increased activity of theta-cells was also observed during locomotion in the spatial exploration task. Time-locked increases in firing to the tone stimulus were restricted to identified theta-cells. Complex spike cells, in contrast to theta-cells, did not increase activity during any phase of tone-discrimination learning or performance. The same cells, however, fired at markedly increased rates coincident with the animals' presence in specific spatial locations during exploration of the platform but did not fire during other overt behaviors on the platform such as grooming, drinking, or locomotion. Complex spike cells qualified on the basis of positive collision tests and antidromic criteria as hippocampal output neurons. “Spatial firing” was unique to complex spike cells and was not observed from theta-cells recorded from the same animal. Twenty-one theta-cells and 31 complex spike cells studied in both behavioral contexts showed mutually exclusive and nonoverlapping electrophysiological firing correlates. No cell was observed in either category which exhibited spatial and tone discrimination related firing correlates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) "

Extracellular field and single-unit activity were recorded by multiple tetrodes and multisite silicon probes to reveal the timing of the activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and classes of interneurons during theta waves and sharp wave burst (SPW)-associated field ripples. The somatic and dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells was deduced from the activity of interneurons in the pyramidal layer [int(p)] and in the alveus and st. oriens [int(a/o)], respectively. Int(p) and int(a/o) discharged an average of 60 and 20° before the population discharge of pyramidal cells during the theta cycle, respectively. SPW ripples were associated with a 2.5-fold net increase of excitation. The discharge frequency of int(a/o) increased, decreased (“anti-SPW” cells), or did not change (“SPW-independent” cells) during SPW, suggesting that not all interneurons are innervated by pyramidal cells. Int(p) either fired together with (unimodal cells) or both before and after (bimodal cells) the pyramidal cell burst. During fast-ripple oscillation, the activity of interneurons in both the int(p) and int(a/o) groups lagged the maximum discharge probability of pyramidal neurons by 1–2 msec. Network state changes, as reflected by field activity, covaried with changes in the spike train dynamics of single cells and their interactions. Summed activity of parallel-recorded interneurons, but not of pyramidal cells, reliably predicted theta cycles, whereas the reverse was true for the ripple cycles of SPWs. We suggest that network-driven excitability changes provide temporal windows of opportunity for single pyramidal cells to suppress, enable, or facilitate selective synaptic inputs."

Rats repetitively performed a sequence of behaviors during each trial: approach to a stimulus-sampling port, investigatory sniffing of the odor cue, orientation and approach toward a separate reward location, and water reward consumption. In a series of post hoc analyses, spike activity was time-locked to variations of each task event to uncover behavioral and physiological parameters that best synchronized unit firing. Three major categories of cells were identified: (1) “Cue-sampling” cells fired after onset of odor-cue sampling. Response magnitude was related to cue valence on both the current and past trials. (2) “Goal-approach” cells fired prior to arrival at either the odor-sampling port or reward cup. A number of sampling and approach cells also had place correlates. However, detailed analyses indicated that specific behaviors associated with increased firing reliably occurred at the same place. Unit activity was at least as well described by behavioral as spatial parameters. (3) “Theta” cells fired at high rates in strict relation to the ongoing limbic theta rhythm. This categorization suggests a functional organization of the hippocampus in which different cell types play complementary roles. Cue-sampling cells activated by discriminative stimuli during attentive fixations may be involved in comparing relative cue valence. Goal-approach cells may be involved in orientation movements for successive cue-sampling periods. Theta cells may provide synchronization of sensory acquisition during sampling, as well as in orientation movements during approach."

We develop an algorithm that can evaluate any well-formed influence diagram and determine the optimal policy for its decisions. Since the diagram can be analyzed directly, there is no need to construct other representations such as a decision tree. As a result, the analysis can be performed using the decision maker's perspective on the problem. Questions of sensitivity and the value of information are natural and easily posed. Modifications to the model suggested by such analyses can be made directly to the problem formulation, and then evaluated directly. "

Christian Albright,1979.0,"<jats:p> This paper examines monotonicity results for a fairly general class of partially observable Markov decision processes. When there are only two actual states in the system and when the actions taken are primarily intended to improve the system, rather than to inspect it, we give reasonable conditions which ensure that the optimal reward function and the optimal action are both monotone in the current state of information. Examples of maintenance systems and advertising systems for which our results hold are given. Finally, we examine the case where there are three or more actual states and indicate the difficulties encountered when we attempt to extend the monotonicity results to this situation. "

The extension captures the idea that operators of a production process may be able to discover and eliminate defects in the system if, during an inspection, they find the process to be “out of control.” Thus, the distinguishing feature of the model is that one inspects the process not only for the purpose of repairing the machine, but also in the hope that the machine will be caught in the act of producing defective output, so that a source of problems is uncovered and eliminated. The paper provides a characterization of optimal inspection policies and suggests the managerial implications: Ignoring the learning benefits of inspection and quality control activities may lead to under-investment in quality improvement activities, which, in turn, may hinder both cost and quality competitiveness.

We illustrate these results using an example with a Bernoulli observable distribution, a beta parameter distribution, and a geometric distribution for for the time between parameter changes.

The algorithm plans parallel- jaw grasping motions for arbitrary two-dimensional polygo nal objects, which need not be of uniform density. Grasping motions are viewed as parameterized operations, where the parameter values that describe an individual operation define an operation space of all possible operations. By combining an analysis of object geometry and the physics of friction, the planning algorithm divides the operation space into regions, where all operations within a given region produce the same final grasping configuration. Task uncertainties are then included by shrinking these regions by the amount of uncer tainty present. The smaller regions that remain after shrink ing indicate all those operations that will successfully result in a given grasping configuration, even if the worst-case combination of errors occurs. <jats:p> Moreover, the grasping operations presented in this paper intrinsically reduce task uncertainty. If an operation is cho sen from a region and executed, then two degrees of uncer tainty will be removed from the object's position when the operation is completed. <jats:p> It is shown that simple squeeze-grasp operations are not sufficient for grasping all possible objects, and offset-grasp and push-grasp operations are added to increase the scope of the planner.

This methodology was originally developed under the assumption that one would be dealing exclusively with actions that produce the same effects in every situation. The extension involves introducing additional subgoals to actions above and beyond the preconditions of execution normally introduced. These additional subgoals, called secondary preconditions, ensure that the actions are performed in contexts conducive to producing the effects we desire. This paper defines and analyzes secondary preconditions from a mathematically rigorous standpoint and demonstrates how they can be derived from regression operators."

Wecker,1977.0,"<jats:p> The rate at which Markov decision processes converge as the horizon length increases can be important for computations and judging the appropriateness of models. The convergence rate is commonly associated with the discount factor α. For example, the total value function for a broad set of problems is known to converge 0(α<jats:sup>n</jats:sup>), i.e., geometrically with the discount factor. But the rate at which the finite horizon optimal policies converge depends on the convergence of the relative value function. (Relative value at a given state is the difference between total value at that state and total value at some fixed reference state.) Relative value convergence in turn depends both on the discount factor and on ergodic properties of the underlying nonhomogeneous Markov chains. We show in particular that for the stationary finite state space compact action space Markov decision problem, the relative value function converges 0((αλ)<jats:sup>n</jats:sup>) for all λ &gt; r(P), the argument of the subdominant eigenvalue of the optimal infinite horizon policy (assumed unique). Easily obtained bounds for r(P) are also given which are related to those of A. Brauer. Under additional restrictions, policy convergence is shown to be of the same order as relative value convergence, generalizing work of Shapiro, Schweitzer, and Odoni. The same result gives convergence properties for the undiscounted problem and for the case α &gt; 1. If αr(P) &gt; 1 the problem does not converge. As a by-product of the analysis, necessary conditions are given for the relative value function to converge 0((αλ)<jats:sup>n</jats:sup>), 0 &lt; αλ &lt; 1, for the nonstationary problem. "

The version with partially observed states is shown to be PSPACE-complete, and thus even less likely to be solved in polynomial time than the NP-complete problems; in fact, we show that, most likely, it is not possible to have an efficient on-line implementation (involving polynomial time on-line computations and memory) of an optimal policy, even if an arbitrary amount of precomputation is allowed.
