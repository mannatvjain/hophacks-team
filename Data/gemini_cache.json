{"Although hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is normally elicited by tetanization of an afferent input, it may also be induced by pairing afferent volleys with strong depolarizing conditioning stimuli. In extracellular recordings made from area CA1 of hippocampal slices bathed with a picrotoxin-containing solution, long-lasting potentiation was produced by high strength single volleys alone. Potentiation occurred with intervals between high strength stimuli as great as one per minute. Tetanization-induced LTP was no greater than tetanization-induced LTP plus high strength single volley potentiation, given in either order. These data suggest that single afferent volleys can induce LTP under conditions of reduced inhibition._Episodic and spatial memories each involve the encoding of complex associations in hippocampal neuronal circuits. Such memory traces could be stabilised from short- to long-term forms by consolidation processes involving the 'reactivation' of the original network firing patterns during sleep and rest. Waking experience can be replayed in many different brain areas, but an important role for the hippocampus lies in the organisation of the 'reactivation' process. Emerging evidence suggests that sharp wave/ripple (SWR) events in the hippocampus could coordinate the reactivation of memory traces and direct their reinstatement in cortical circuits. Although the mechanisms remain uncertain, there is a growing consensus that such SWR-directed reactivation of brain-wide memory traces could underlie memory consolidation._Review of the normally occurring neuronal patterns of the hippocampus suggests that the two principal cell types of the hippocampus, the pyramidal neurons and granule cells, are maximally active during different behaviors. Granule cells reach their highest discharge rates during theta-concurrent exploratory activities, while population synchrony of pyramidal cells is maximum during immobility, consummatory behaviors, and slow wave sleep associated with field sharp waves. Sharp waves reflect the summed postsynaptic depolarization of large numbers of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and subiculum as a consequence of synchronous discharge of bursting CA3 pyramidal neurons. The trigger for the population burst in the CA3 region is the temporary release from subcortical tonic inhibition.\nAn overview of the experimentally explored criteria of synaptic enhancement (intensity, frequency, and pattern of postsynaptic depolarization, calcium influx, cooperativity, threshold) suggests that these requirements may be present during sharp wave-concurrent population bursts of pyramidal cells. Experimental evidence is cited showing that (a) population bursts in CA3 may lead to long-term potentiation in their postsynaptic CA1 targets, (b) tetanizing stimuli are capable of increasing the synchrony of the sharp wave-burst, and (c) activity patterns of the neocortical input to the hippocampus determine which subgroup of CA3 neurons will trigger subsequently occurring population bursts (initiator cells).\nBased on the experimental evidence reviewed a formal model of memory trace formation is outlined. During exploratory (theta) behaviors the neocortical information is transmitted to the hippocampus via the fast-firing granule cells which may induce a weak and transient heterosynaptic potentiation in a subgroup of CA3 pyramidal cells. The weakly potentiated CA3 neurons will then initiate population bursts upon the termination of exploratory activity (sharp wave state). It is assumed that recurrent excitation during the population burst is strongest on those cells which initiated the population event. It is suggested that the strong excitatory drive brought about by the sharp wave-concurrent population bursts during consummatory behaviors, immobility, and slow wave sleep may be sufficient for the induction of long-term synaptic modification in the initiator neurons of the CA3 region and in their targets in CA1.

Stimuli applied to the caudal part of the dorsal psalterium evoked a complex response in the dorsal third of the entorhinal area. The early part of the entorhinal response consisted of a slow wave interrupted by a spike potential. The electrophysiological characteristics and the laminar distribution of the slow wave and of the spike potential, together with the presence of time-locked unit activity, suggested that dorsal psalterium projections evoke monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials leading to cellular discharge in radially oriented neurons of layers II and III. The commissural fibers responsible for these effects originate in the contralateral presubiculum. The early part of the entorhinal response was followed by three waves in close temporal sequence. These waves were polysynaptically generated and associated with excitatory and inhibitory synaptic effects. Inhibition was demonstrated for the monosynaptically generated spike potential. Whether these effects were mediated by intracortical circuits and/or extrinsic projections cannot be stated from the present results. Causal relations were observed between the entorhinal monosynaptic response and that evoked by dorsal psalterium stimulation in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus, previously shown to be relayed by perforant path fibers.33\nThe results indicate that presubicular commissural projections to the entorhinal area monosynaptically activate neurons of the perforant pathway, whose discharge brings about activation of the ipsilateral dentate gyrus._The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment.

High frequency stimulation of the commissural/associational system enhanced both the incidence and amplitude of the drinking associated SPWs up to 48 h.

This use-dependent malleability is of considerable interest because it may serve as a substrate for memory processes. However, in the neocortex, whose involvement in learning is undisputed, attempts to demonstrate LTP have remained inconclusive6\u20138. Here we use intracellular recording techniques to show that LTP can be induced by high frequency stimulation of the optic radiation in slices of the visual cortex of adult rats. We identify as a necessary prerequisite for the induction of LTP the activation of the membrane channel that is associated with the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor. Selective blockade of this receptor system with DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate consistently prevents LTP as in most hippocampal pathways9\u201311. In most cortical neurons the activation of the NMDA mechanism and hence the induction of LTP in these experiments requires a concomitant reduction of GABAergic inhibition by low doses of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline. This indicates that in the neocortex the activation threshold of the NMDA-mechanism and consequently the susceptibility to LTP, are strongly influenced by inhibitory processes._Review of the normally occurring neuronal patterns of the hippocampus suggests that the two principal cell types of the hippocampus, the pyramidal neurons and granule cells, are maximally active during different behaviors.

Following 2AP5 delivery, complex spike firing decreased by a mean 36%, while only a 5% decrease was observed after saline injection. This effect could not be explained by changes in firing rate per se but appeared to be related to the degree of blockade of commissurally induced long-term potentiation. Thus 2AP5 not only disrupts synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus but can also alter the pattern of ongoing activity of the pyramidal cells._The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment.

Brief, high\u2010frequency stimulation of the perforant path results in a long\u2010term potentiation (l.t.p.) of the field response evoked in the dentate gyrus by single shocks to the perforant path. We have compared the magnitude and duration of l.t.p. in normal, anaesthetized rats with animals depleted of noradrenaline (NA), 5\u2010hydroxytryptamine (5\u2010HT), or both. 2. All animals were exposed to an identical sequence of eight high\u2010frequency trains of increasing intensity given over a period of 140 min to the perforant path of one hemisphere. The potential evoked by test shocks to the perforant path was monitored in both hemispheres throughout this period and for a further 96 min after the last train. 3. Plots of the mean potentiation of the population e.p.s.p. as a function of time were computed for all animals in each group. L.t.p. in the NA\u2010depleted group was about 50% of that in the non\u2010depleted control group throughout the course of the experiment. L.t.p. in the 5\u2010HT\u2010depleted group was more severely affected; mean potentiation did not exceed 30% of that in the control group at any time. 4. The duration of l.t.p. was unaffected by NA depletion and reduced by 5\u2010HT depletion. 5. The threshold for the intensity of high\u2010frequency current pulses necessary to elicit l.t.p. was unaffected by NA depletion and raised by 5\u2010HT depletion. 6. Short\u2010term potentiation of the population e.p.s.p. was unaffected by either NA depletion or 5\u2010HT depletion. 7. The effect of monoamine depletion on granule cell excitability was investigated. 5\u2010HT depletion, but not NA depletion, induced an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population, in the sense that a population e.p.s.p. of a given size was associated with a larger population spike. 8. Long\u2010term potentiation of granule cell excitability was not affected by NA depletion, but was reduced by 5\u2010HT depletion. 9.

The trigger for the population burst in the CA3 region is the temporary release from subcortical tonic inhibition.\nAn overview of the experimentally explored criteria of synaptic enhancement (intensity, frequency, and pattern of postsynaptic depolarization, calcium influx, cooperativity, threshold) suggests that these requirements may be present during sharp wave-concurrent population bursts of pyramidal cells. Experimental evidence is cited showing that (a) population bursts in CA3 may lead to long-term potentiation in their postsynaptic CA1 targets, (b) tetanizing stimuli are capable of increasing the synchrony of the sharp wave-burst, and (c) activity patterns of the neocortical input to the hippocampus determine which subgroup of CA3 neurons will trigger subsequently occurring population bursts (initiator cells).\nBased on the experimental evidence reviewed a formal model of memory trace formation is outlined. During exploratory (theta) behaviors the neocortical information is transmitted to the hippocampus via the fast-firing granule cells which may induce a weak and transient heterosynaptic potentiation in a subgroup of CA3 pyramidal cells. The weakly potentiated CA3 neurons will then initiate population bursts upon the termination of exploratory activity (sharp wave state). It is assumed that recurrent excitation during the population burst is strongest on those cells which initiated the population event. It is suggested that the strong excitatory drive brought about by the sharp wave-concurrent population bursts during consummatory behaviors, immobility, and slow wave sleep may be sufficient for the induction of long-term synaptic modification in the initiator neurons of the CA3 region and in their targets in CA1. In this two-stage model both exploratory (theta) and sharp wave states of the hippocampus are essential and any interference that might modify the structure of the population bursts (e.g. epileptic spikes) is detrimental to memory trace formation._The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.": "Related papers"}
