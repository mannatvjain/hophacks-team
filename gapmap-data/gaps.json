    "description": "For over five decades, silicon-based CMOS technology has driven unprecedented progress in computing and information technology through dimensional scaling following Moore's Law. This miniaturization has led to exponential increases in transistor density, performance, and energy efficiency. However, as transistor channel dimensions shrink below a few nanometers, silicon and conventional bulk semiconductors (e.g., SiGe, III-V materials) are encountering insurmountable fundamental physical and material limits (heat dissipation, short-channel effects, etc.).",

A general-purpose approach to atomically precise fabrication was envisioned by Drexler in the 1980s and Feynman in the late 1950s. DNA origami made a leap in 2006, but DNA is in some key ways a much less precise and versatile nanoscale building material than proteins/peptides. A promising path would extend “DNA origami” to “protein carpentry” by adapting Beta Solenoid proteins, or other modular protein components with programmable binding properties, as lego-like building blocks and then using the latter to construct massively parallel protein-based 3D printers for lego-like covalent assembly of a restricted set of chemical building blocks. This one is riskier: how programmably can we really control protein assembly, and could we bootstrap from initial crappy prototype protein-carpentry-and-or-DNA-origami-based molecular 3D printers to genuinely useful ones? ",

Today’s robotic hardware is often prohibitively expensive and built using legacy designs that do not prioritize cost reduction, modularity, or scalability. Moreover, many robots struggle with dexterity and tactile sensing, and current design practices decouple hardware and software, preventing a co-evolution that could unlock new performance regimes. Overcoming these limitations requires a rethinking of both robot morphology and control, with an emphasis on integrated design, cost-effective production, and enhanced functionality.\r\n",

This has been very successful in the radio (see Event Horizon Telescope) but in the optical regime requires extremely difficult optomechanics and controls, and the sensitivity on the ground is inherently limited by the coherence time of the atmosphere. \r\n",

Additionally, technology-driven improvements in administrative efficiency could free valuable resources, enhancing educational equity and overall student experiences.\n\n“US K-12 teachers are 30% more likely to face burnout than U.S. soldiers, whose lives are defined by relentless duty, perpetual war and low wages.” - Adrienne Williams \n\n“Given recent improvements in the quality, affordability, and usability of technologies like AI, computer vision, and AR/VR, we can reimagine a more personalized, research-driven K-12 experience—one better able to meet diverse learning needs and set students up for success both in school and in life. From chatbots for individual coaching to immersive mixed reality solutions to adaptive technologies supporting culturally responsive pedagogy, we have an opportunity to leverage new technologies to tackle pressing needs across literacy education, STEM instruction, and preparing students for the workforce.” - Kumar Garg ",

However, a wide array of conditions still eludes cures and treatments. We have yet to fully decipher the dynamic interplay between brain and peripheral systems, the bioenergetic processes underlying chronic conditions, and the multifactorial pathways that drive aging. The biological mechanisms driving complex diseases and the aging process are multifactorial, involving multiple interacting pathways. \n\nAlthough we understand some individual aging mechanisms, we do not yet have line of sight to comprehensively rejuvenating mammals or extending lifespan. To overcome these challenges, we need combinatorial approaches that can modulate multiple mechanisms simultaneously, allowing us to measure multi-system impacts and develop effective interventions.",

    "description": "Understanding the complete wiring of the brain at single–cell resolution, along with detailed molecular annotations, is critical for revealing how neural circuits support learning, memory, and behavior. Current technologies are prohibitively expensive and lack scalability, limiting our ability to link molecular composition with circuit connectivity and to understand the alterations present in brain disorders. This gap fundamentally makes diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of many brain disorders more difficult. Beyond the biomedical applications, maps of brain circuitry could play a fundamental role in grounding principles of safety for brain-like AI systems.\n\nInitiatives like the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s transformative projects (the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN), the BRAIN Initiative Connectivity Across Scales (BRAIN CONNECTS) Network, and the Armamentarium for Precision Brain Cell Access) represent important efforts to illuminate foundational principles governing the circuit basis of behavior and to inform new approaches to treating human brain disorders by radically enhancing our understanding of brain cell types and the tools needed to access them (The BRAIN Initiative® 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures).",
