    "description": "Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, especially transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), have potential to shrink transistors beyond the scaling limits of silicon. Unlike silicon, which suffers from degraded performance at channel thickness < 12 nm, 2D materials are \"dangle-bond-free,\" meaning their surfaces are naturally stable and less prone to defects. This allows them to maintain high carrier mobility and low leakage currents even at atomically thin channel thickness.\r\n\r\nWafer-scale growth of monolayer TMD material has been demonstrated and prototype transistors have shown feasibility of outperforming conventional transistors. However, their industrial adoption requires optimization for industrial manufacturing, integration with semiconductor foundry processes, and standardized methods for characterizing material properties and device performance.",

    "description": "No rock survives from the Hadean - but that is because Earth has plate tectonics. Statistically, there must be Hadean rocks waiting on ancient Lunar terrains for us to find (just as there are abundant Lunar meteorites on Earth). A plausible Earth mineral has already been identified in Apollo samples (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X19300202). They will be easy to spot due to their distinct mineralogy (and color). However, raking through the Lunar regolith to find them is tedious work, beyond the patience of astronauts - but not beyond the patience of robots. This is a NASA science goal, but it is undervalued, due to the intense focus on Lunar resources.",

The solution is to search for more Hadean zircons with the steady, systematic approach of (for example) a diamond company, and then screen massive numbers of zircons for ocean and atmosphere data.",

A gap remains in high-resolution, full-depth ocean data that AI models could exploit for improved climate forecasts.",

DNA origami made a leap in 2006, but DNA is in some key ways a much less precise and versatile nanoscale building material than proteins/peptides. A promising path would extend “DNA origami” to “protein carpentry” by adapting Beta Solenoid proteins, or other modular protein components with programmable binding properties, as lego-like building blocks and then using the latter to construct massively parallel protein-based 3D printers for lego-like covalent assembly of a restricted set of chemical building blocks. This one is riskier: how programmably can we really control protein assembly, and could we bootstrap from initial crappy prototype protein-carpentry-and-or-DNA-origami-based molecular 3D printers to genuinely useful ones? \n\nSafety consideration: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/15/8/001 \n\nStrategy consideration: https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-paretotopian-goal-alignment ",
