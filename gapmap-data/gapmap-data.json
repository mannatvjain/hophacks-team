Despite advances in tools and chassis engineering, there are few robust platforms that translate synthetic biology into scalable, field-ready solutions. This includes not only the production of low-impact proteins and agricultural inputs but also bioremediation technologies for legacy pollutants—such as pesticide-laden soils, heavy metals, and nutrient runoff—that degrade ecosystems and constrain land use. A new generation of synthetic biology platforms is needed to address both sides of the problem: replacing harmful production methods and cleaning up their long-term consequences.",

A general-purpose approach to atomically precise fabrication was envisioned by Drexler in the 1980s and Feynman in the late 1950s. DNA origami made a leap in 2006, but DNA is in some key ways a much less precise and versatile nanoscale building material than proteins/peptides. A promising path would extend “DNA origami” to “protein carpentry” by adapting Beta Solenoid proteins, or other modular protein components with programmable binding properties, as lego-like building blocks and then using the latter to construct massively parallel protein-based 3D printers for lego-like covalent assembly of a restricted set of chemical building blocks. This one is riskier: how programmably can we really control protein assembly, and could we bootstrap from initial crappy prototype protein-carpentry-and-or-DNA-origami-based molecular 3D printers to genuinely useful ones? ",

Innovative technologies have the potential to significantly reduce these burdens by providing tools that assist teachers with scheduling, grading, and creating personalized, adaptive lesson plans. Digital platforms could dynamically tailor learning experiences to individual student progress, complementing classroom teaching. Additionally, technology-driven improvements in administrative efficiency could free valuable resources, enhancing educational equity and overall student experiences.\n\n“US K-12 teachers are 30% more likely to face burnout than U.S. soldiers, whose lives are defined by relentless duty, perpetual war and low wages.” - Adrienne Williams \n\n“Given recent improvements in the quality, affordability, and usability of technologies like AI, computer vision, and AR/VR, we can reimagine a more personalized, research-driven K-12 experience—one better able to meet diverse learning needs and set students up for success both in school and in life. From chatbots for individual coaching to immersive mixed reality solutions to adaptive technologies supporting culturally responsive pedagogy, we have an opportunity to leverage new technologies to tackle pressing needs across literacy education, STEM instruction, and preparing students for the workforce.” - Kumar Garg ",

However, a wide array of conditions still eludes cures and treatments. We have yet to fully decipher the dynamic interplay between brain and peripheral systems, the bioenergetic processes underlying chronic conditions, and the multifactorial pathways that drive aging. The biological mechanisms driving complex diseases and the aging process are multifactorial, involving multiple interacting pathways. \n\nAlthough we understand some individual aging mechanisms, we do not yet have line of sight to comprehensively rejuvenating mammals or extending lifespan. To overcome these challenges, we need combinatorial approaches that can modulate multiple mechanisms simultaneously, allowing us to measure multi-system impacts and develop effective interventions.",

      "description": "Understanding the complete wiring of the brain at single–cell resolution, along with detailed molecular annotations, is critical for revealing how neural circuits support learning, memory, and behavior. Current technologies are prohibitively expensive and lack scalability, limiting our ability to link molecular composition with circuit connectivity and to understand the alterations present in brain disorders. This gap fundamentally makes diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of many brain disorders more difficult. Beyond the biomedical applications, maps of brain circuitry could play a fundamental role in grounding principles of safety for brain-like AI systems.\n\nInitiatives like the NIH BRAIN Initiative’s transformative projects (the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN), the BRAIN Initiative Connectivity Across Scales (BRAIN CONNECTS) Network, and the Armamentarium for Precision Brain Cell Access) represent important efforts to illuminate foundational principles governing the circuit basis of behavior and to inform new approaches to treating human brain disorders by radically enhancing our understanding of brain cell types and the tools needed to access them (The BRAIN Initiative® 2.0: From Cells to Circuits, Toward Cures).",

Unlike silicon, which suffers from degraded performance at channel thickness < 12 nm, 2D materials are \"dangle-bond-free,\" meaning their surfaces are naturally stable and less prone to defects. This allows them to maintain high carrier mobility and low leakage currents even at atomically thin channel thickness.\r\n\r\nWafer-scale growth of monolayer TMD material has been demonstrated and prototype transistors have shown feasibility of outperforming conventional transistors. However, their industrial adoption requires optimization for industrial manufacturing, integration with semiconductor foundry processes, and standardized methods for characterizing material properties and device performance.",

Statistically, there must be Hadean rocks waiting on ancient Lunar terrains for us to find (just as there are abundant Lunar meteorites on Earth). A plausible Earth mineral has already been identified in Apollo samples (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X19300202). They will be easy to spot due to their distinct mineralogy (and color). However, raking through the Lunar regolith to find them is tedious work, beyond the patience of astronauts - but not beyond the patience of robots. This is a NASA science goal, but it is undervalued, due to the intense focus on Lunar resources.",

DNA origami made a leap in 2006, but DNA is in some key ways a much less precise and versatile nanoscale building material than proteins/peptides. A promising path would extend “DNA origami” to “protein carpentry” by adapting Beta Solenoid proteins, or other modular protein components with programmable binding properties, as lego-like building blocks and then using the latter to construct massively parallel protein-based 3D printers for lego-like covalent assembly of a restricted set of chemical building blocks. This one is riskier: how programmably can we really control protein assembly, and could we bootstrap from initial crappy prototype protein-carpentry-and-or-DNA-origami-based molecular 3D printers to genuinely useful ones? \n\nSafety consideration: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/15/8/001 \n\nStrategy consideration: https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-paretotopian-goal-alignment ",

      "description": "We need a way to programmably induce immune tolerance to a user-defined foreign protein, in order to enable many new forms of gene and cell therapy (not to mention help with autoimmune diseases). This is especially needed for brain computer interface as many of the most powerful concepts for BCI would involve adding foreign protein such as transducer proteins for optical or acoustic signals. As Hannu Rajaniemi wrote, “a flexible ability to induce immune tolerance to opsins is a prerequisite of a two-way mind meld with computers”.",

Such a study would illuminate the role of infections in increasing disease risk and progression.\n\nThis effort could serve as a sequel to the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that have been performed since the completion of the Human Genome Project. Many diseases failed to show obvious genetic etiologies from those GWAS efforts, suggesting a role for the environment in disease causation. Large-scale infection profiling could therefore unearth etiologies that were not possible to detect by GWAS.",
